9630	16070.0	All of Us - The All of Us Research Program and Public Libraries	The National Institutes of Health and the National Library of Medicine have partnered to support public libraries in meeting the health information needs of their patrons and engaging their communities around the All of Us Research Program. This preconference will discuss programming ideas, funding opportunities, and community engagement for public libraries around issues of health literacy, precision medicine, and All of Us. Participants will learn about the All of Us Research Program and its goal of addressing health disparities and advancing medical research. Attendees will explore how to create fun and informative health-related programming through hands-on interaction and health resources for their communities.     The National Institutes of Health&#039;s All of Us Research Program is an unprecedented effort to gather data from one million or more people mirroring the diversity of the United States to accelerate research and improve health. By taking into account individual differences in lifestyle, environment, and biology, researchers will uncover paths toward delivering precision medicine. This preconference will provide an overview of the All of Us Research Program, precision medicine, and the National Institutes of Health&#039;s partnership with the National Library of Medicine, and how public libraries can support the health literacy and knowledge of their patrons.  
9651	4941.0	Seeds of Hope	The Clinton-Essex-Franklin Library System (CEFLS) in Plattsburgh, New York is seeking an award to raise awareness regarding the topic of domestic violence among residents in Clinton, Essex, and Franklin counties. CEFLS plans to collaborate with STOP Domestic Violence to coordinate a series of events in our shared service area. This will include hosting the National Library of Medicine (NLM) traveling exhibit Confronting Violence, Improving Women&#039;s Lives; providing viewings of the feature documentary, Home Truth, followed by a training session on resources; offering book club and resource discussions addressing domestic violence; and coordinating an awareness event for youth.
9683	20000.0	Resources and Services for Community Health Nursing Clinics Across the State of Nevada	"To support community health nurses across the State of Nevada by providing instruction and promotion of freely available health information, with a focus on National Library of Medicine (NLM) resources. This award would allow us to re-visit the nursing clinics across the state. Funding will be used for visits to gather input from the nurses and to strengthen our online portal that was developed during the first year of funding from NNLM PSR.  

This project will promote access to quality information and provide greater support for rural care providers in Nevada. We will again provide instruction and support for evidence-based public health practice through in-person instruction. We will promote our online modules, which cover a variety of information resources and topics, and each module will offer Continuing Education (CE) credit for nurses. 

Providing health services in remote areas is a challenge. Public Health Nursing is provided through the Nevada Division of Public and Behavioral Health to Nevadaâ€™s 10 frontier and rural counties. In addition to providing essential services such as immunizations, nurses in these areas serve as school nurses in school districts that lack such personnel. The area of responsibility covers more than 96,000 square miles, with nurses averaging 1,000 miles per month of travel through the rural counties to support the health and wellness of Nevadans. We plan to use funding during this period to strengthen and enhance our relationships with and services to this important group of care providers."

9785	18279.0	Community Health in the Library (CHIL)	The Community Health in the Library (CHIL): Reinvigorating Outreach at the UIC Crawford Library of the Health Sciences project will improve access to high quality, reliable health information for the city of Rockford, Illinois and the surrounding Winnebago County community. UICâ€™s Crawford Library of the Health Sciences, hereafter referred to as the Crawford Library, has had a long history of participating in community outreach, educating the community on the National Library Medicine (NLM) resources, and housing a Consumer Health Collection specifically for the community. However, in recent years due to financial uncertainty and budget reductions throughout the state of Illinois, the Crawford Library has not been able to support the Consumer Health Collection and outreach activities at the same levels. The CHIL project will reinvigorate the aging collection, the libraryâ€™s presence in the community, and the communityâ€™s use of NLM resources. CHIL activities will include teaching workshops at community sites, purchasing print and audio/visual materials, hosting â€˜mini exhibitsâ€™ that feature the NLMâ€™s Online Exhibits, and generally promoting NLM resources and the Library. This reinvigoration of outreach at the Crawford Library will result in improved access to reliable health information for the public.
9788	49510.0	Health Online: Finding Information You Can Trust	â€œHealth Online: Finding Information You Can Trustâ€ will help persons from underrepresented populations better access, identify and use reliable health information on the internet. With todayâ€™s focus on obtaining information online or going mobile, there has become a digital divide for individuals with low health literacy, many of whom are represented among vulnerable populations, using online and other digital tools for health (Pew, 2015). Through this project, Wisconsin Health Literacy (WHL) will offer 32 â€œdigital health literacyâ€ workshops for consumers most at risk for low health literacy, including seniors and individuals with low literacy. WHL uses a proven workshop model which relies on partnership with local organizations to reach vulnerable populations through educational programs offered in trusted settings. WHL will leverage its past experience conducting over 400 of these collaborative workshops on a variety of health topics to create and implement this new program on digital health literacy. Community partners are scattered across the state and will include non-profit literacy councils, 80 of which are members of Wisconsin Literacy. Additional historic partners include public libraries, Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRCs), senior centers, Indian tribes, refugee organizations, and community health centers. (See letters of support.) The workshop delivery and training structure will emphasize training and materials that can be disseminated and used by partnering organizations so that they can continue to offer the program to new participants going forward. There is a variety of training publicly available to help consumers use online health information. However, these sources are less likely to be used by vulnerable populations due to limited digital health literacy. A second project component involves providing 4 regional workshops for librarians, especially in rural areas, on how to effectively help persons with low health literacy find trustworthy health information. This will help them feel more confident in helping all library customers seeking health information, but especially those who have lower health literacy and less on-line expertise.
9806	49835.0	Food Wisdom Repository: Information Resources for Native Nutritional Health	This project undertakes outreach activities to further development of, and facilitate access to, a public knowledge repository of information on Indigenous nutritional health. The Research for Indigenous Community Health (RICH) Center at the University of Minnesota is building a curated database of reliable information resources relevant to Native nutritional health, accessed via a public website. Drawing from multiple sources of â€œfood wisdomâ€â€”including experiential, community-based, and cross-disciplinary academic knowledgeâ€”this searchable repository provides a directory of experts, a bibliography of scholarly publications and grey literature, and information on relevant projects, programs, and resources. Supported by a gift from the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Communityâ€™s Seeds of Native Health initiative, and guided by first-round needs assessment, the RICH Center has built a proof-of-concept test site. The proposed project will further development of the repository into a fully-functioning, publicly-accessible prototype, and maximize its accessibility, through collection and analysis of additional user data. In the first half of the award period, advised by the External Consultants and the University of Minnesotaâ€™s Usability Lab, the Project Director and Outreach Associate will conduct needs assessment and user testing with selected target users: health workers (health practitioners, health and nutrition educators, program managers, project coordinators, and other public and community health workers) who are working most directly within Native communities to foster health and well-being through food and nutrition. Analysis of user data will guide content development, database structure, and interface design for the prototype. The proposed project also includes assessment of the need for training resources to help target users access and utilize the repositoryâ€™s resources. Advised by the External Consultants, the Project Director and Outreach Associate will collaborate with the Outreach Librarian for the University of Minnesotaâ€™s Health Sciences Library to assess the training needs of two audiences: health workers, and information professionals who serve Native communities. In the second half of the award period, they will analyze data collected on training needs, identify priority needs, and plan for development of high-priority training resources.
9809	20000.0	CLUES Health and Well-being Workshops	CLUES requests funding from the NNLM to support a Health and Wellbeing workshop series for the second program year. The workshops will take place in areas of Minnesota where large communities of Latinos live and work, including southern Minnesota (in areas such as St. James and Austin). The workshop curriculum has recently been conceptualized and created by CLUESâ€™ Behavioral and Community Health staff, and covers topics across well-being, including healthy behaviors (healthy eating, active living, tobacco cessation), communication, and dealing with difficult emotions (regulation of feelings and its expression, trauma). Additionally, new sessions will be added to respond to the needs of the community we serve in St. James. Each workshop course will connect participants to National Library of Medicine Resources, including MedlinePlus, to provide families with access to resources for increasing their knowledge of health topics long after the workshops. The envisioned Health and Wellbeing workshop series will be especially valuable in increasing access to health information for Latinos in Greater Minnesota, who typically do not have access to culturally and linguistically relevant health or human services.

9909	19874.0	Wash & Learn: Health Libraries in Laundromats - Minnesota	Libraries Without Borders (LWB) will facilitate health literacy programs inside laundromats in 3 new counties in Minnesota as part of LWBâ€™s Wash &amp; Learn Initiative (WALI). Implementing partners include the Minnesota State Library Services, the Saint-Paul Public Library, the Anoka County Library, and the Scott County Library. LWB will write and publish 3 case studies drawn from each county, highlighting best practices, We will share these findings across Minnesota through LWBâ€™s partnership with the State Library Services. At the macro level, LWB aims to test several new methodologies of facilitation in order to better understand how to onboard low-income families to effectively use NNLM resources. In each laundromat space, laundromat clients will gain access to curated WiFi hotspots that re-direct them to MedLine Plus resources on personal devices. LWB will also work with the library systems to facilitate health literacy workshops and convene public health organizations to offer workshops during the laundromatâ€™s peak hours.
9912	1962.0	Women's Health Wednesdays	We will focus on several different topics of womenâ€™s health, including heart disease, reproductive safety and health, depression and mental health, eating healthy, working out, cancer, yearly screenings, autoimmune disease, caring for a loved one, and self-defense. We will hold 9 sessions, each one hour long, once per month from August through April. We want the women in our communities to understand and value their own health and wellness. We have a lot of women who have no insurance (or are under insured) that we see coming into the library asking for materials on different health topics, such as breast cancer and ways to de-stress. We want them to not only know the information from a respectable professional, but also to know that they can go to Aunt Marthaâ€™s, even with no insurance, and get the help they need to stay healthy.
9915	12358.0	Improving Health Awareness Through Access to Quality Health Information	This request seeks to fund the purchase and support of 20 iPads loaded with NLM consumer health information for adults and children. This proposed project is a partnership between the Charlevoix Public Library and the Munson Charlevoix Hospital Education Department. The iPads will be placed in the Library, the Hospital Wellness Workshop facility, in selected physicians&#039; and school nurse offices and used in health clinics for American Indians and community senior events. The Health Librarian will train the health professionals to use the iPads and review specific NLM databases. The information will be reviewed semi-annually to ensure that the resources are up to date. The rural counties of Antrim and Charlevoix counties which constitutes the Library and Hospital&#039;s patron base, have many health challenges associated with obesity, diabetes and alcoholism. Access to mental health professionals and specialists is scarce. These chronic health issues combined with a general population that has limited computer skills, makes this a ideal environment to provide NLM health information for adults and children on user-friendly iPads. The mission of the Charlevoix Public Library is to connect the community to resources that educate, enrich and empower. The Library has been a partner with the Munson Charlevoix Hospital Wellness Workshop since inception, providing community health information based on NLM resources. The Wellness Workshop supports the Hospitals&#039; mission to improve the health and wellness of the community through health education, nutrition classes and health screenings.
9953	20000.0	How to Maximize Your Health Insurance Benefits	Lack of access to treatment for youth living in medically underserved areas with a mental health condition can lead to poor academic performance, substance use, hospitalization, and attempted or completed suicide. The 2008 Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act requires health insurance plans to provide mental health and substance use disorder benefits equal to those of medical/surgical benefits, and the Affordable Care Act requires plans to offer mental health care benefits. Despite this advancement, surveys show that people are not aware of these changes and are not accessing the mental health care available to them through their insurance policies. Further, if youth and parents are unaware that the symptoms they are experiencing could be related to a mental health condition, they will not access care for these conditions. Through a NNLM grant From May 2017 to April 2018 DBSA improved health information literacy and access to mental health care by: educating youth influencers on how to access existing and new DBSA youth mental health information posted on MedLine in both English and Spanish; delivered workshops in underserved areas to educate and train youth influencers and parents on how youth can access greater mental health and substance use care and treatment options for themselves or their children through insurance benefits already available to them; trained them on how to work with insurance plans when benefits are denied; posted workshop presentation and webinar on MedLineâ€”health insurance category; worked with community partners to increase knowledge of these tools; included training on how to use MedLine in workshops. To expand on this program, DBSA proposes to reach professional youth influencers to include social workers, librarians and school personnel by creating a 4-hour workshop that provides continuing education credits. Curriculum includes 2-hour instruction on insurance and mental health parity and 2-hour instruction on how to use MedLine and HealthReach as a resource for obtaining additional information on youth behavioral health resources. This program will build on continued work in Illinois and be expanded to reach under-served health communities in Wisconsin.
9986	19900.0	County-Level Health Data Fair	The Making County-Level Health Data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) Initiative will consist of three phases in order to establish and sustain an online interface for local health professionals and librarians to access and analyze county-level health assessment data, as well as educate these individuals on utilizing this resource and creating their own data management plans. The first phase of this proposed project will be to develop and implement a database where raw data from Richland County health assessments can be accessed and analyzed by local health professionals and librarians. The second phase will consist of the creation and hosting of a data access and management webinar to introduce Richland County health professionals and librarians to the online interface. Finally, phase three will provide an additional webinar to 12 rural North Central Ohio Counties in an effort to educate their local health professionals and librarians about data management plans as well as how to access, analyze, and contribute to the Making County-Level Health Data FAIR Initiative database.
9989	19060.0	Interactive Health Information Kiosks in Richland County Libraries	The Interactive Health Information Kiosks in Richland County Libraries project will consist of four phases in order to establish and sustain the installment of interactive health information kiosks at Richland Countyâ€™s local libraries, as well as educating the public on identifying relevant, accurate, and appropriate health research. The first phase of this project will be to obtain and install health information education kiosks at all 9 Richland County libraries. In addition to the kiosks, each library will be equipped with user education and instructional materials to accompany the kiosks. The second phase will consist of outreach to local health care settings, including primary care physicians and pharmacies, to educate and inform practices about the kiosks and programming at the libraries. Health care professionals will be given informational flyers to make available to their patients. The entire practice will be educated when possible, including non-physician team members. During this phase, library employees will also be educated and trained on the usage and importance of the kiosks. Phase three will be completed by educating the target audience of residents who live in rural areas. A series of workshops on health information and the kiosks will emphasize the importance of health information, personalized medicine, improve health literacy, and how to do health research on their own by utilizing NNLM resources. Through phase four, additional promotional materials about the kiosks will be distributed to further advertise the initiative. The allocation of these promotional materials will be disseminated through local health fairs, the blood pressure kit program Richland Public Health currently hosts at all 9 branches of the Richland County Libraries as well as current Richland County Library health programming and resources, and advertisements through Richland Public Health and Richland County Library websites, social media accounts, and local Richland County media outlets.
9992	17846.0	Research Data Management Best Practice Implementation Program for Graduate Students in STEM and Health Sciences	The Research Data Management Best Practice Implementation project supports the National Network of Libraries of Medicine (NNLM) goal of building â€œcapacity in data management practices, services and tools to support FAIR data guiding principles (1)â€. This program will increase graduate student knowledge of data management best practices, promote student understanding of how data management integrates into their research work, and determine if these practices are adopted long term. This pilot uses a flipped classroom model to present the students with appropriate practices in an eight-week intensive program. In a flipped classroom, the students are expected to engage with the instructional content outside the classroom, while using the in-person classroom time to engage in activities that demonstrate competency and understanding of the content. In this program, the classroom time is used to systematically develop and holistically integrate these practices in to their research projects. The topics include discovering disciplinary standards, creating a project map, developing folder structures and file naming conventions that reflect the project workflow, and devising strategies for sustaining these practices as their projects evolve. The UIC Library has a history of sustained support for research data management through both instruction and personalized consultation. However, there is little research that demonstrates the long-term adoption of data management best practices after receiving instruction or personalized support. This pilot project is unique in that it addresses both education about data management practices and the integration of best practices into the research workflow in a personalized manner. This project will begin to fill the research gap by examining the longitudinal effects of data management instruction and integration support. 1. National Network of Libraries of Medicine.

9995	9511.0	Teaching Health Literacy to Underserved Youth	Background: Low health literacy has been associated with poor health outcomes and socioeconomic factors. Milwaukee has a lower educational attainment and diverse medically underserved populations within the city. Health literacy is a national concern and is part of the mission of the National Library of Medicine and its network of Regional Medical Libraries. Youth health literacy has not been measured; many health education programs have been cut or reduced in primary and secondary schools and health literacy is not mandated or funded. It has been determined that youth needs to learn how to best search for and evaluate online health information. Objective: This project will Implement a sustainable youth health literacy curriculum in a health education course at Vel R.

9998	13300.0	Technology 174 - Action Behind Education	"Chronic Illness and Disease Awareness (CIDA) is the only organization in our community that seeks to educate the Tri-Cities community about chronic illnesses. Research studies show that increasing numbers of community members have been diagnosed with chronic illnesses, exponentially growing the health illiteracy rate in our community. Recognizing this, the purpose of this project is titled â€œAction Behind Educationâ€â€”action that will require a two-fold project. First, in order to improve health literacy in the Tri-Cities area it is necessary that CIDA increase the number of healthcare workshops conducted and simultaneously launch Computer Lab sessions that enable, promote awareness, and use of NLM resources. Second, in order to provide community members access to consumer health information it is vital that the Color My World Healthy Library at Carver Parks and Recreation Center (CP&amp;R) be updated. CIDAâ€™s primary objective in this project is to increase health literacy among children and seniors through expanding its workshops and creating new Computer Lab sessions that provide participants with increased access to NLM resources. CIDA purposes to accomplish this through frequent workshops at the CP&amp;R. These workshops are written by the CIDA administration, reviewed for accuracy by Quillen College of Medicine Library librarians, and taught by ETSU students/health professionals to children at the CP&amp;R. Along with these workshops, CIDA is determined to promote the awareness of NLM resources through new e-Library Computer Lab sessions. To further increase health literacy in the Tri-Cities area, CIDA aims to create an updated e-library that promotes the awareness and use of NN/LM resources. This e-library would have resources available for children and adults on various diseases, illness prevention techniques, and healthy lifestyle tips. It is our goal that this two-fold project will ultimately reduce health illiteracy in the Tri-Cities community.	"
10001	14745.0	Technology 171 - Deployment and Use of iPad Minis in an Urban Academic Medical Center & Health System	"Dahlgren Memorial Library at Georgetown University Medical Center is seeking funding for a project designed to assess the utility of iPad Mini tablet devices for use by neonatal intensive care unit and pathology residents at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, DC. Research has been conducted in the use of the iPad in several clinical point of care and training settings including with physical medicine and rehabilitation residents (Niehaus, et al, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Resident Use of iPad Mini Mobile Devices. PM R. 2015 May;7(5):512-8.) and an otolaryngology â€“ head and neck surgery inpatient service (Crowson, et al, Utility of Daily Mobile Tablet Use for Residents on an Otolaryngology Head &amp; Neck Surgery Inpatient Service. J Med Syst. 2016 Mar;40(3):55).

Little data has been tabulated or studies conducted to determine the clinical utility of the iPad Mini tablet device. The Niehaus et al. study states there is minimal research on the use of smaller tablet devices in residency programs, and most of the previous studies were conducted with standard-sized iPad tablet devices. Dahlgren Memorial Library staff working with clinicians at Georgetown University Medical Center and MedStar Georgetown University Hospital propose the purchase and deployment of the devices and to study their utility in a point-of-care clinical setting as the residents rotate through various clinics onsite at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, and in clinical settings throughout the Washington DC area. Resources staff at Dahlgren Memorial Library have built an extensive collection of electronic materials which currently provides access to 6,500 journals and 4,500 eBooks,. All digital content in the Dahlgren Memorial Library collections are integrated into National Library of Medicine resources such as PubMed. Deployment of the iPad devices will facilitate access to National Library of Medicine databases and Dahlgren Memorial Library resources. "
10004	14999.0	Technology 161 - Continuing on PATHS (Patient/Parent Access To Health Sources) Leading to Excellent Patient Care	Continuing on PATHS Leading to Excellent Patient Care will allow patients and families of the University of South Alabama (USA) Medical Center and the High Risk OB/GYN and Well Baby units of the USA Childrenâ€™s &amp; Womenâ€™s Hospital to access quality health information through the use of Android tablets. Nurse educators and other health care professionals at both facilities will have a means to enhance the current individual educational needs of the patients, parents and family members by accessing the free electronic resources from the National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health. Android tablets and rolling bedside stands will be purchased so patients have access to these resources. MedlinePlus, Drug Information Portal, and LactMed are a few that will be accessible so patients can locate information free of medical jargon, in their native language, and at a time when they can absorb the material. The tablets will be available at any time during their hospital stay. Printed brochures from the National Library of Medicine will also be distributed to patients. One-on-one sessions will be provided by the librarian in the USA Cardiac Clinic. This award would continue the work of a previous NNLM award received in November 2016 which enabled chronically ill children and their parents at USA Childrenâ€™s &amp; Womenâ€™s Hospital to access MedlinePlus and other NIH resources from tablets. By providing access to health information using multiple educational interventions, more patients in this health disparate community can take an active role in the understanding of their condition and become engaged in an interdisciplinary team approach to their medical care. The additional resources from NNLM will provide patients the ability to locate quality health information not only at the time of need, but beyond, thus improving their health outcomes. The project will document the efficacy of the various interventions by using evaluations and discharge surveys.
10007	12793.0	Research Data Management 294 - Equipping Citizen Scientists to Make a Difference: Developing a Plan for an Online Course	A citizen scientist is either a member of the public who works with a scientist to gather data to collaboratively solve a problem, or is investigating a research question on their own. In our information and data rich society, it is important to equip citizen scientists with the research skills that will enable them to conduct sound scientific investigations. Their research outcomes can be applied to solve an issue, raise awareness, or advocate for change. The Health Sciences and Human Services Library (HS/HSL) at the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) proposes to equip people to become effective citizen scientists. A team at the HS/HSL will develop an online course breaking down citizen science and research methods into understandable components. The course will be offered free of charge. There will be an optional citizen scientist certificate available for a nominal fee. This proposal requests funds to plan an online course in anticipation of receiving a future award. The online course will be comprised of approximately six classes, each containing distinct topical units. Classes will be mounted on the edX platform and utilize a variety of instructional methodologies such as short lectures, animation, slides. There will be additional resources, assignments, and an evaluation tool developed.

10013	14985.0	Library Project 162 - NSU-MD Annual Hackathon â€œNEHATâ€ at HPD Library	The Martin &amp; Gail Press Health Professions Division Library at Nova Southeastern University (NSU) in collaboration with The Kiran C. Patel College of Allopathic Medicine (NSUMD) will host a healthcare hackathon, a multi-day event, in which a large number of students will meet to engage in a collaborative environment to address community health issues, stimulate university-wide inter-professional partnership and promote a culture of exploration and innovation. The healthcare hackathon will bring together NSU students for a 48-hour innovation marathon in an effort to address local health care concerns, specifically pertaining to patient education and bridging the gap between knowledge and practice. The hackathon will include community speakers from non-profit health organizations, faculty mentors and expert judges. The students will come together and work in groups to develop projects to solve healthcare issues within the community. Winning projects will receive post-hackathon support in order to assist with prototyping and connecting students to further resources for turning their ideas into reality. Hackathon projects and outcomes will be distributed across NSU via a website, and student projects will be incubated in our community to maximize visibility and impact. This initial health hackathon will serve as a proof of concept to establish a sustainable and repeating annual hackathon, which can be scaled to include potential collaborations among neighboring institutions. This hackathon will also serve as NSUMDâ€™s inauguration of their â€œNever-Ending Hackathonâ€ - a continuously supported cycle for health innovation projects available to NSU students via online communication and dedicated mentorship and support. Funding is being requested from the NNLM/SEA Medical Library Project Grant to partially fund planning and event day.
10016	13833.0	Library Project 156 - Supporting Student and Faculty Exploration of Bioprinting in UAB Libraries	The University of Alabama at Birminghamâ€™s Lister Hill Library of the Health Sciences has long been recognized as a leading health sciences library in the state of Alabama. In 2017, the library added two LulzBot Taz 6 3D printers as part of a university-funded project intended to investigate the feasibly of creating anatomical and molecular models for use in the libraryâ€™s circulating collection. The 3D printed models currently available for check out in the library have been very enthusiastically received by students, and there is a high amount of faculty interest in future uses of models to enhance instruction and training. The library would like to continue to explore opportunities to provide students and faculty access to new technologies by making an Allevi 1 bioprinter and the associated software and knowledge base available to members of the UAB community. Three-dimensional printing and bioprinting are rapidly developing technologies that are not yet integrated in to health sciences curriculums, even though applications of technologies are beginning to appear in clinical settings. Making bioprinting available for student and faculty learning in the library will provide a unique opportunity for self-directed learning in an intersectional space at the university. Having access to these tools in the library will enable interested students, faculty, and staff to explore potential applications for these technologies in current instructional settings, as well as providing a forum for faculty who have read about these new tools in the health sciences literature to visit the library to build a basic set of skills and understanding of potential applications as a route to developing new research interests.
10019	14817.0	Library Project 151 - Collaborating to Host a Research Data Management Symposium	Data discovery is becoming an increasing trend with the availability of public data sets as a part of the open access movement. Data sharing is developing norms and establishing standards to increase research reproducibility. Data management skills are required to execute the data life cycle steps, including creating, accessing, sharing, and re-using data. As health care begins to harness big data and other data sets for discovery purposes, scientists need to understand data management and incorporate best practices into their research. Discussions around data management often occur within individual departments or colleges on a university campus; however, the health sciences library has the opportunity to support an interdisciplinary, consolidated effort to connect researchers and resources across all disciplines. Greenblatt Library will conduct a needs assessment of the University researchers and stakeholders to assess the current climate and knowledge of data management on campus. Using the assessment results, the library will partner with the Universityâ€™s Vice-President for Research, Biostatistics, IT, Cancer Center, and Center for Nursing Research to host a day-long research data management symposium. National and local speakers will be invited and the format will include breakout sessions, a panel discussion, and displaying National Library of Medicine data science resources. The symposium will be planned for spring 2019 and aims to provide professional development for university researchers and librarians, and foster collaborative relationships with the campus research community. Continuing education credit will be sought for both health professionals and librarians attending. Greenblatt Library requests funding from NNLM/SEA Medical Library Project in support of this symposium inspiring best practices for research data management across the institution.
10022	5360.0	Library Project 139 - MLA Special Content Session: Transforming Libraries Using Implicit Bias Training	This session, sponsored by the African American Medical Librarians Alliance (AAMLA) of the Medical Library Association, will provide attendees with an overview of implicit bias, the impact it has in libraries and in health care, and more importantly how it stands in the way of diversity and inclusion initiatives on our campuses. An implicit bias occurs when we have attitudes towards people or associate stereotypes with them without our conscious knowledge. Addressing the diversity and inclusion issues in librarianship have been a stated priority in librarianship for a number of years yet the profession continues to struggle with operationalizing the concepts in our work. There are a number of efforts to diversify librarianship yet librarianship remains to be a largely homogenous profession. The demographic makeup of US communities continues to change, so it&#039;s imperative that the library workforce reflects the community being served. A number of contributing factors have been identified that impact the lack of racial and ethnic diversity in the profession. One of the identified contributing factors is implicit bias. Growing research indicates that implicit biases impacts the actions we take and decisions we make in our personal and professional lives. In the work setting, implicit biases are likely a contributing factor to the lack of diversity in librarianship as it likely impacts who gets hired, which programs get funded, and which services are offered. The invited speaker for this session will define implicit bias, provide examples of what it looks like in the workplace, and offer strategies that librarians may use to identify and overcome their own biases.
10025	5000.0	Outreach 195 - Speaker Series: Genetics, Lifestyle Choices and the Environment Can Impact a Personal Health	Oftentimes academic universities, public libraries, and churches serve as cultural centers to communities that offer a variety of workshops to promote wellness and health awareness. Accordingly, Woodruff Health Sciences Center (WHSC) Library seeks to collaborate with library administrators from Clayton, Cobb, and Atlanta-Fulton County public library systems, student groups at Emory University, church parishioners from Wheat Street Baptist Church, and librarians from Georgia Tech and Georgia State to host a speaker series that will foster increased comprehension of genetics and how lifestyle choices and the environment can impact a personâ€™s health. Along with reviewing diverse genetic-related health topics, speakers will showcase diverse consumer health resources (i.e. MedlinePlus, Genetics Home Reference, etc.) and illustrate how patrons can utilize them to make more informed decisions about their health. A component of the proposed series includes hosting movie viewings of the film The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks with discussions about clinical trials and the importance of participating in ethical studies. The speaker series is comprised of topics including: what are clinical trials and how to enroll, NIHâ€™s All of Us research program, and the impact of genes and oneâ€™s health. This project seeks to target communities of color who use these institutions for they are typically underrepresented in clinical trials and are often impacted the most by chronic illnesses that derive from changes in genetic health, lifestyle choices, and environmental factors.
10030	5000.0	Health Information Hub at the Chicago Public Library	The project proposed is a health information hub inside a regional Chicago Public Library currently undergoing extensive renovations in a disadvantaged community that suffers from a spate of health conditions.  The library, one of only two regional libraries in the city is frequented by 25,000 patrons each month and the goal is to improve both community awareness and health literacy by making information more accessible and culturally relevant to a predominantly African-American community.  The Endeleo Institute is the community development arm of Trinity United Church of Christ, the venerable faith-based institution that for more than five decades has been a pillar for socieconomic justice in the Washington Heights community.  In 2014, Endeleo spearheaded a community-led effort to restore the nearby library that for decades, had fallen into significant disrepair.  Beyond the physical improvement, the restored public facility (scheduled to reopen in September 2018) will serve as a model platform for a user-friendly data project designed to renew social capital in a neighborhood where the social determinants of health (e.g. high unemployment, violence, substandard housing, blight and disinvestment, poor education, lack of safety, social relationships) contribute to poor health outcomes.  Collaboratively, we intend to build a culture of health. 
10033	5350.0	Outreach 194 - The Wash & Learn Initiative for Health Literacy in Greater Washington, D.C.	"Health literacy is a critical pathway to better health outcomes. Yet for countless low-income families, health resources like those on MedlinePlus are simply out of reach. Some are unaware of its existence while others lack the digital skills that enable access to the materials. By meeting people where they areâ€”while waiting at the laundromatâ€”Libraries Without Borders (LWB) strives to empower low-income families with the information they seek in a manner that suits their everyday schedule. In partnership with the Coin Laundry Association (a trade group), we will facilitate health literacy programs inside one pilot laundromat in Greater Washington, D.C.. Once the site is set-up, we will convene community-based organizations and health providers to offer services at the laundromat according to the needs identified by initial surveys. For example, we will explore integrating brochures and guides from NIMH and the Capital Area Food Bank on nutrition; inviting REALTalk DC, DC Hunger Solutions, Young Womenâ€™s Project, and the Center for Health and Health Care in Schools to facilitate their programs inside the laundromat; and referring laundromat clients to enroll in programs implemented by Community of Hope and Bowen Center Clinic. Findings from this pilot in Greater Washington, D.C. will build upon similar pilots conducted in Minnesota and will improve understandings about how to customize and iterate health literacy programs in laundromats within different geographic and demographic contexts. Results from this program will also be utilized to apply for an IMLS National Leadership grant, working towards creating best-practices and tools that will support public libraries across the country in building out their own laundromat
outreach health literacy programs."
10036	10382.0	Outreach 172 - For the Public Good: Connecting Research and Community	The program is to build awareness about the importance of how participating in clinical research studies can bring about better therapies for diseases. We will briefly outline the research process, and then describe how participatory research is changing how research is done â€“ doing research with, rather than to, research subjects. We will briefly discuss how data science and the National Institutes of Healthâ€™s All of Us precision medicine research program are examples of newer approaches to include rural, underrepresented, or ignored populations in the community in clinical research studies. A recent program sponsored by Augusta University about Henrietta Lacks was well received and attended so there is local interest in medical research topics. A larger amount of time will be spent demonstrating how to find disease and drug information in MedlinePlus, and then to a lesser extent, how ClinicalTrials.gov can locate studies and how PubMed Health seeks to inform about the effectiveness of therapies. This program will be coordinated with Federally Qualified Health Centers and public libraries located in urban, suburban, and rural settings as either a standalone program or part of other public outreach events. Participation in the annual Greater Augusta Healthcare Network meeting and symposium will bring the precision research message of All of Us to FQHCs, hospitals, and public health leaders in the Augusta region. Equipment will be needed to present the program and also for participating FQHCs and libraries to showcase the National Library of Medicine databases to the public.
10040	1638.0	Outreach 167 - Augusta-Richmond Community Health Outreach Project	The Augusta-Richmond Community Health Outreach Project will provide reliable and free access health information to residents within the Richmond County. Working with public libraries as a host venue, various speakers and officials will teach participants about health issues relevant to the Augusta area such as opioid use, Alzheimerâ€™s disease, cardiovascular disease, domestic abuse, and diabetes. Over six months, there will be six presentations about the selected topics with two of the presentations being about opioid use. The six presentations will be spread out equally over the six months and vary on time of day given. Each of the speakers will be an expert in their respective public health or health sciences fields. They will speak about the current health statistics and trends concerning their topic in the local area, warning signs of health concerns to watch for, what actions are being taken to prevent risks, and what actions are being taken to manage future risk. Each presentation will correlate to the NNLM mission of improving access to health information and supporting outreach that promotes awareness. The health and population information shared at the presentations will integrate facts from evidence-based studies and use NLM resources.
10044	14918.0	Outreach 160 - Collaborative for Health Literacy: East End Consumer Health Outreach and Computer Access	At 12% proficiency, U.S. health literacy sets the population at disadvantage for consumer health outcomes and overall healthcare costs (NCES, 2006; DHHS, 2017). While efforts exist for improvement via rewriting and training in plain language, these strategies are found to be limited â€œpieces of a process that must be placed in a larger community contextâ€ (NNLM, 2018). Witnessed in this context is variance in access to health resources multiplied by effects of social determinants such as aging, low socio-economic and minority status. Addressing these factors with cultural and community competent health literacy engages individuals in promising self-advocacy for health, but advancements of today also require technology skills to keep pace with online health communications (Levy, Janke &amp; Langa, 2015; Sakar, Karter &amp; Liu, 2010). Led by partners at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), the VCU School of Medicineâ€™s Center on Health Disparities (CoHD) and VCU Librariesâ€™ Community Health Education Center (CHEC), this project promotes National Library of Medicine (NLM) resources for online consumer health in interdisciplinary collaboration with public libraries, state and local health agencies. The project will provide community trainings at neighborhood centers in a historically African American, low-income, food and resource desert community of Richmond, Virginia. Participants will receive small group health literacy education via a mobile computer lab to enhance technology access, health application knowledge, and connection to health services and providers. The outreach supports NLM mission through collaborative action that addresses health information needs, improves health information literacy, and ensures healthcare consumers are aware of and have access to high-quality health information resources. This project aims to advance public health by improving access to information and skills that enable individuals to make informed decisions about their health.
10048	14839.0	Outreach 157 - Development and Dissemination of a Health Information Literacy Training for Rural Youth	Residents of rural communities face increasing challenges to optimizing health and well-being. Beyond structural barriers, health disparities in rural areas are heightened due to lack of access to quality health information. This project seeks to address this issue by developing a health information literacy training (INQUIRY) tailored to rural youth. Media specialists (library and information science professionals) in middle and high schools across rural counties of Eastern NC will be instructed on how to deliver the INQUIRY training, thus providing increased access to high-quality health information to youth and their families. INQUIRY training will include multiple NLM resources and creative activities to engage youth in locating and evaluating health information while focusing content examples on substance use disorders, which is a heightened concern in rural counties of NC. The impact of this project will be expanded through provision of an on-line training on INQUIRY to be disseminated to other professionals in youth serving organizations such as public libraries. Finally, this project will comprehensively assess information needs of media specialists to inform future efforts to meet NLM&#039;s goal of equalizing health information access and empowering all consumers to make informed decisions about their health.
10051	15000.0	Outreach 153 - Project TORDS-Technology Outreach to Reduce heath Disparities and Stigma	The purpose of Project â€œTORDSâ€ is to increase health technology literacy access in rural and underserved communities in southern West Virginia. â€œTORDSâ€ will focus on disenfranchised and marginalized communities with limited access to internet and smart phone connections. The program will provide 10 internet-accessed computers in McDowell and Mercer Counties and provide two days a week per county for communities to access the internet. SCED will provide two hours per day/per site for internet access training.

10060	10000.0	AoU Community Engagement 268 - Library Outreach Tricycle Initiative	The Library Outreach Tricycle Initiative (LOTI) will provide a novel means of outreach service for the Miami-Dade Public Library System. The Allapattah Branch Library (henceforth, â€œthe libraryâ€) serves the Village of Allapattah in the City of Miami and Miami-Dade County, Florida. With grant support, The library will procure outreach equipment in the form of a cargo tricycle with a â€œlibrary boxâ€, an accompanying tricycle, tablet and internet technology for exhibiting and accessing health resources, and a small collection of books and materials to be housed on the book tricycle. The outreach equipment will permit the library to expand on its outreach programming in a fun and visible fashion in the community of Allapattah. These outreaches will include, but not be limited to, the promotion and extension of consumer health information services through access to high quality materials and computer databases. Health information resources education, informing about the All of Us research initiative which seeks to survey a larger proportion of underrepresented populations, and ensuring the visibility of the library in the community beyond the walls of the building are the projectâ€™s primary purposes. The outreach equipment will allow the library to attend to locations frequented by the community in an effort to bring the library to where the people are. Outreach ensures the library is perceived as relevant third spaces in the community with the missions of life-long learning and informal education. The outreach equipment will foster curiosity as an unusual means of conducting outreach. The trikes also reflect a dedication to healthy, active lifestyles, even while working. A multitude of outreach sites and opportunities present when as options for the trikes for â€œfirst-mileâ€ sites such as schools, parks, colleges, recreation areas, and partnered events.
10063	7116.0	AoU Community Engagement 267 - Improving Health Information Literacy with the EVMS Library: A Hampton Roads Community Initiative	As one of the only medical schools in the nation founded by a grassroots effort from the local community, Eastern Virginia Medical School (EVMS) is committed to addressing our communityâ€™s most pressing health needs through our educational, research, and clinical programs. The Edward E. Brickell Medical Sciences Library (EVMS Library) shares in this commitment and believes that an All of Us Community Engagement Project award aligns with our vision. This award would enable the EVMS Library to help increase our local communityâ€™s healthcare literacy and awareness by working with existing initiatives on campus and partnering with our public libraries. As part of this endeavor we would promote the importance of ongoing research such as the All of Us Research Program and encourage community members to use freely available NLM resources.
10066	9842.0	AoU Community Engagement 263 - Health Science Library Information Outreach: Supporting Public Libraries Supporting All of Us	Public libraries are known for being community centered institutions providing equitable access to information and resources. Seen as trusted members of the community and the â€œgo-toâ€ for information, public librarians play an important role in improving individualâ€™s access to health information and overall well-being. Through this project we will assess the information needs of pubic librarians within Memphis to better inform our efforts to meet NNLMâ€™s goal of improving access to information enabling community members to make more informed health decisions. By establishing partnerships between the UTHSC Health Sciences Library and public libraries throughout Memphis, this project seeks to address community challenges to optimizing health and well-being through health literacy and health information trainings. The main objective of this project is to increase knowledge and utilization of high-quality health information resources of public library staff through the development of training sessions and educational activities. Using the â€˜Train-the-Trainer&#039; approach, we aim to support public libraries in their ability to carry out health information and health literacy sessions in their communities in order to support health equity and the All of Us Research program.
10069	10000.0	AoU Community Engagement 261 - Project HEAL (Health Empowerment and Literacy)	Project HEAL will combine health literacy with English language instruction at the Trident Literacy Association (TLA) in Charleston, SC. TLA has provided comprehensive literacy programs, GED preparation, English as a Second Language (ESL), Computer Basics, WorkKeys and Civics and Citizenship programming since 1972. Incorporating health literacy into the existing program provides a unique opportunity for students. TLA uses the South Carolina Adult ESL Handbook and ESL Scope and Sequence South Carolina Adult Education standards. The project aims to utilize technology with ESL students to teach the skills needed to access reliable health information and empower students to make informed decisions about their individual and family health. With the primary goal of supporting the mission of NLM, the curriculum will utilize NLM products, All of US Research program and the local Hands on Health-SC resources as primary sources for health information needs. MUSC Library staff will conduct 12 weekly (two hours, two classes per day) training designed to enhance skills and empower students. Upon completion of the 12 weekly sessions, students will attend a mini-health fair (conducted on site) to practice skills and receive services.
10072	6068.0	AoU Community Engagement 260 - Promoting Healthly Previentive Care for Senior Adults and First-year Students at Alabama A & M University	Drake LRC wants older African Americans and students to make healthy choices and avoid risky healthcare behaviors. However, the potential pitfalls for senior adults and students are great. Drake LRC proposes to make available through workshops and health fairs the content from the NLM databases to combat alcohol abuse, hypertension, eye care, diabetes, and other health topics that can promote good preventive healthcare.
10075	10000.0	AoU Community Engagement 259 - Empower Parents -Equipping Parent Caregivers With Health Literacy Skills	"Empower Parents will equip parent caregivers with much needed health literacy tools and skills. Parents with children suffering from disease, illness or disability are often not informed with credible health information placing their children at risk. As the caregivers to child patients, parents are tasked with the job of becoming an expert on the health needs of their children but yet not given appropriate tools or resources. Often parents face multiple adversities such as low socioeconomic status, low literacy, English as their second language and/or have little knowledge of healthcare in general. The Consumer Health Librarian would become a source of information and education for these parent caregivers. 
This would begin with classes designed and presented for parent caregivers in person and via webinars. The classes would be offered within the community in places such as YMCAs, community organizations, public libraries and children&#039;s hospitals throughout the community. Resources would be ordered and given to parent caregivers in their native languages and at lower reading levels enabling better understanding or comprehension. Videos and podcasts would also be created for parents to view and listen to. Scientific research shows that 50% of what is taken into the human brain comes only when a person hears and sees information at once. This would be the overall goal when sharing information with parent caregivers.

10131	1500.0	PD 178 - Systematic Review Training for Librarians	Health sciences librarians have been involved with systematic reviews since this publication type was first introduced in the 1990s. A recent article published in the January 2018 issue of the Journal of the Medical Library Association (JMLA) identifies 18 roles where librarians can be involved in the systematic review process. Additionally, this article acknowledges that library and information professionals play an integral role in systematic review support beyond the traditional expert searching role at their institutions. While the Georgia Health Sciences Library Association (GHSLA) has provided a range of continuing education offerings to its members, we have not offered a course on information services or information management since 2014. The Medical Library Association (MLA) identifies 6 key professional competencies, among them are information services and information management, both of which are addressed within systematic review training and service implementation. Providing a face-to-face systematic review workshop at our quarterly meeting will expand our membersâ€™ professional knowledge and promote member engagement with research and data for those supporting faculty, clinicians, students, and researchers conducting systematic reviews. Accordingly, the skills health sciences librarians gain at this workshop can be applied at their respected institutions, allowing them to train other health information professionals across the state of Georgia in the steps required to conduct effective systematic reviews.

10216	19727.0	Narrowing the Health Gap in Cincinnati	Despite improvements in medical care and efforts to make healthcare more affordable for all Americans, many still experience significant heath disparities that result in poor health outcomes. Racial and ethnic minorities, those in rural and/or urban areas, and those living in medically underserved areas have a high risk for experiencing health related disparities. Access to authoritative health information is vital to ensuring that individuals make appropriate health decisions and reduce their risk of experiencing poor health outcomes. The University of Cincinnati Health Sciences Library in collaboration with Cincinnati Childrenâ€™s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), Interact for Health, and The Childrenâ€™s Home of Cincinnati aim to provide health information resources and healthy cooking demonstrations in an effort to increase health literacy and reduce health disparities in the greater Cincinnati region. Community-level data has provided information regarding areas of Cincinnati that would receive the greatest benefit from these resources. We will apply a targeted approach to reach individuals in these areas and provide them with easily accessible, pertinent health information, and instruction on preparing healthy, low-cost meals. 1. We will place a blood pressure kiosk and an interactive kiosk displaying health related information in a location that is frequented by individuals from these identified areas. The kiosks will allow for automated monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate and relevant health information. 2. We will host a series of cooking classes where participants will be introduced to the DASH Diet, a program that will help them reduce their risk for a number of diseases. They will learn how to prepare low cost, healthy food while also how to make budget friendly food decisions. 3. We will create a publically accessible website that will house health related videos and information for the public. This website will be accessible from any device with internet access and will provide information from the kiosks as well the cooking classes. Our goals are to increase health literacy among those most affected by health disparities by providing detailed, user-friendly health information and to provide instructions and tools to help families use nutrition information to make healthier food choices.

10222	9321.0	Iowa Public Health Research Center (IPHRC) at Allen College	Allen College, UnityPoint Health is a regionally-accredited, private, nonprofit institution of higher education located in Waterloo, Iowa. Built on a tradition of more than 90 years of excellence, Allen currently serves 625 students in seven health programsâ€”nursing, public health, radiography, sonography, medical laboratory science, medical imaging, and occupational therapyâ€”ranging from associates to doctorates. Allen Collegeâ€™s Barrett Library provides access to over 33,000 library materials, including 47 databases, 3,200 online journals, 3,100 streaming videos, and over 12,000 physical texts. As a premier repository of biomedical and health information, Barrett Library seeks to link local health professionals, especially those in underserved areas, to these resources. Through the Iowa Public Health Research Center (IPHRC) at Allen College, Barrett Library will provide 25 counties in Northeast Iowa with no-cost equal access to library materials. As of right now, county health departments and government funded non-profits that provide public health services have limited access to peer-reviewed journals and are often unfamiliar with NNLM resources, which constitute the primary source of evidence-based practices needed to solve community health problems. Allen Collegeâ€™s IPHRC project librarian will be available throughout the grant period to respond to item requests; locate, assess, and share resources; answer questions; produce literature reviews; and collaborate with healthcare providers to find the best solutions for their needs. In order to ensure that everyone involved knows how to best navigate federal health information resources, programming will include training sessions for interested participants and train-the-trainer initiatives for library staff. Expanding programming is another primary aim. Within the first year, Barrett Library hopes to add additional counties, based on capacity. Grant participants will be able to visit the library in person during regular operating hours or submit an e-mail request through the IPHRC web page twenty-four hours a day. During the workweek, all requests will receive an initial response within one business day; and all correspondence will be completed within 3 business days. Requests submitted after 4 pm on Friday, over the weekend, or during holiday closures will receive a response by 5 pm the following business day.

10665	10000.0	Improving Cancer Survival Rates in the Fire Service 2019-2020	15-40 Connection and the National Network of Libraries of Medicine both work to provide access to vital health information to improve quality of life and the healthcare experience, especially in those audiences identified to have a greater need for these services. To close the gap in delayed diagnosis of cancer and provide the best medicine for cancer- early detection- individuals need to be empowered through an integrated approach to health education that drives behavior change. 15-40 Connection is the only organization that is using the power of patient awareness as the focus in the path to diagnosis with its 3 Steps Detect early detection education. 15-40 Connection is teaching audiences in high schools, universities, hospitals, corporations and community groups how to recognize early warning signs of cancer and how to work with doctors to detect their cancer at the earliest stages. A critical element of this education is continuity, reinforcement and access to reliable information and advice. Our partnership with the National Network of Libraries of Medicine has allowed for the incorporation of NNLM/Medline Plus resources into our 3 Steps Detect early detection education. All audiences we teach are provided Medline Plus as their credible resources for reliable and up-to-date information regarding doctor/patient relationships, symptoms, confidentiality and patient&#039;s rights.
10672	9693.0	Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor: Accessible Recreation and Physical Activity	This grant application is to fund adaptive kayaking events supported by the Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor Volunteers-In-Parks program in partnership with Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park. To be held at the Douglas State Forest, Douglas, MA. This grant application is to support individuals with who have assorted disabilities. At these events trained volunteers will assist individuals with disabilities, their caretakers, and their family members with accessing NNLM websites and databases, especially MedLinePlus, to increase their awareness of, and access to, knowledge on health information for people with disabilities. This work is needed because people with disabilities are in poorer health and much less active than their able-bodied peers.
10675	10000.0	Media Health Effects: A Tool for Researchers	"The explosion of digital technologies in the 21st Century has not only transformed the ways in which we learn, communicate, and live, but also created a public need for evidence-based answers on how we can mindfully incorporate media and technology into our lives. Adolescents between the ages of 13 and 17 use screen media for almost 9 hours per day, and school aged children are spending nearly 6 hours per day with their devices.1 Even younger children are commonly using media, with 90% of children using media before they turn 1.2 Media-related health and well-being issues such as video game addiction, pornography use, cyberbullying, and more are often addressed using a personal values-based approach as opposed to basing decisions on the extensive scientific evidence base that existsâ€”whether it be positive or negative. As a result, we are seeking funding to support the development of Media Health Effects, a free and publicly available website translating the scientific evidence behind how media and technology affects health, available for all stewards of children, adolescents and young adults. This project will increase awareness use of NLM information resources. Article citations will link to
their corresponding record in PubMed, thus promoting a core NLM resource. It will also strengthen communications and connectivity for health, i.e. infrastructure. By creating a new and robust vector for real, evidence-based research to reach and be understood by a broad audience, Media Health Effects will serve as a bridge between the intended research audience and wider populations, including the general public."

10684	9835.0	Massachusetts-Based Health Education Tour 2019-2020	HAMA will be conducting a Massachusetts-Based Health Education tour from May 2019 â€“ August 2019. The objective of this project stems from the need for more culturally-specific delivery of health information to underserved communities. Last year, HAMA conducted this project for the first time. Based off the success of the project and needs assessment obtained through surveying recipients of the educational sessions â€“ we have decided to repeat this project for continued impact within our Haitian community in the Massachusetts area. Through this initiative we aim to visit 20 different businesses, high schools, faith-based and community organizations providing health education in order to promote awareness and prevention of hypertension, stroke, and obesity. The Haitian community will also be educated on the importance of fostering quality relationships between school nurses, Haitian students, their parents, and families (a continuation of a previous project conducted with one of our partnering organizations Northeastern University). HAMA will also be partnering with Quinnipiac University physical therapy students to create a culturally sensitive video with verbiage in the Haitian Creole language. This video will role play the experience of a stroke patient and the benefits received when pursuing rehabilitation post stroke diagnosis. Furthermore, this project will be a vehicle to highlight culturally-specific health information available through Medlineplus.gov, while helping HAMA to continue building partnerships and collaborations with key stakeholders.
10687	1800.0	Instruction Retreat for Health Sciences Librarians	"Instruction is a growing responsibility of academic health sciences librarians, but we rarely have the time, space, and community to take our ideas and notes from the previous year, combine it with the literature, and
brainstorm with colleagues. This grant will fund a much-needed opportunity for librarians doing instruction in health sciences, at academic institutions to step away from their day-to-day responsibilities and instead work on instruction-based projects that have built up over the year and intentionally focus on refining their pedagogy. Participants will be able to immediate start integrating the work they do at the retreat into their instruction practice. Our vision is for a highly interactive, self-directed retreat in which participants individually decide how to divide their time between learning about and working on specific aspects of their instruction practice including learning outcomes, beta-testing new learning activities, mapping curriculum, discussing pedagogy, and exploring instruction statistics. We will also provide access to pedagogy-focused learning materials and peer experts who can offer refresher/introductions on these topics and most importantly, the mental space to focus."
10690	9929.0	Health Literacy and Health Information Resource Education in the Lawrence Community	Health literacy is the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information in order to make informed health decisions. Limitations in health literacy are associated with ineffective care, poor compliance, increased use of health services and poor health outcomes. Evidence suggests there are disproportionate health literacy limitations among Latino populations, adults with limited English proficiency, immigrant status, and minority status. The city of Lawrence Massachusetts is comprised of a predominantly Hispanic (~60,000) population with the majority of these residents speaking English as a second language. Furthermore, 28.4% of the residents fall below the poverty line, double the national average. Due to the existing health literacy barriers of language, poverty and immigration status for many Lawrence residents, and the negative consequences that result from inadequate health literacy, this project will provide free health literacy education to this vulnerable population through a multidisciplinary, collaborative community partnership. We propose to continue to offer Health Education And Literacy (HEAL) classes and a MedlinePlus consumer health information workshop to adult English as second language learners at the Notre Dame Education Center- Lawrence for the 2019-2020 academic year in order to improve the knowledge, skills, motivation, and confidence for adults to actively engage in their health.

10696	10000.0	NNLM Public Health Alliance to Connect, Teach, and Serve (PHACTS)	"Pomperaug District Department of Health (PDDH) will leverage its vast network of community partners to implement a focused outreach program to connect underserved older adults to MedlinePlus resources in order to curtail opioid dependence and provide alternative strategies for managing chronic pain. The NNLM Public Health Alliance to Connect, Teach, and Serve (PHACTS) initiative will deliver Stanford Universityâ€™s 6-week evidence based chronic pain selfmanagement program (CPSMP); and Boston Universityâ€™s 8-week evidence-based Matter of Balance (MOB) falls prevention program; and hands-on instructional MedlinePlus workshops at local libraries and senior centers. Augmenting the CPSMP and MOB workshops will be an Opioid Awareness and Resource Day, during which MedlinePlus Opioid Abuse and Addiction resources will be distributed. Medical Reserve Corps (MRC) members will assist public health professionals with PHACTS implementation, thereby ensuring volunteer engagement and program sustainability. PHACTS will raise awareness of the high prevalence of falls, and impaired balance in older adults with pain in the US, as outlined in the 2011 National Health and Aging Trends Study. Risk of unintentional overdose for older adults who rely on prescription pain medication is rising, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA): while opioid abuse declined sharply among 18 to 25-year-old between 2002 and 2014, the epidemic almost doubled among Americans over age 50. Specific aims of this project include: increasing awareness and perpetuating proficiency in accessing MedlinePlus resources for older adults and the people who care for them; promoting alternative pain management strategies through the delivery of evidence-based healthy aging workshops; and facilitating community opioid awareness presentations for older
adults who rely on prescription medications to manage pain"
10699	10000.0	Continuing the Public Health Museumâ€™s educational community outreach program 2019-2020	The Public Health Museum is a non-profit educational and cultural museum located in a building listed on the National Register of Historic Places on the grounds of Tewksbury Hospital founded in 1854. The mission of the Public Health Museum is two-fold: to educate the public about the achievements and contributions of public health in preventing disease and improving the health of individuals and communities in Massachusetts and worldwide; and to inspire students, researchers, health care workers and public health professionals to build upon the past and continue to advance the future of public health. Our Museum provides an environment to explore public health, inspire future public health professionals, and foster community involvement. The museum will do this by continuing to invest in our goal of connecting students and community partners with each other and advance career knowledge about Public Health via our current scheduled events. Specifically, we wish to expand the museumâ€™s public health outreach programs using NLM resources for both historical and current day application of public health information resources while collaborating with local community groups.
10702	6000.0	Improving Access to Health Education: Part II - Creating Professional Development Opportunities to Reduce Textbook Costs 2019-2020	For the students of Springfield Technical Community College (STCC), the cost of an education continues to be a significant issue. More than half of STCC students receive Pell Grants for low-income students. In addition to the cost of tuition, fees, transportation to and from school, and basic living costs, students also struggle with the cost of textbooks and course materials. The cost is significantly high for students looking to train in the health sciences, where an individual textbook can cost more than $200. In order to make the STCC health programs more accessible to underserved communities, the College must examine ways of making the programs more affordable. The STCC Faculty Fellowship Program, started in 2018 with support from NNLMNER, has resulted in an increase of courses that use materials that are openly licensed and or/ available through the STCC Library and the National Library of Medicine, rather than traditional, proprietary textbooks. Because of this success, STCC is looking for a more sustainable way to encourage faculty adoption of free and open resources. The proposed project seeks to continue the Faculty Fellowship Program, but with some distinct changes that will further advocate for open resources and also ensure continuation of the campus OER initiative beyond the period of funding. This project seeks to demonstrate that the availability of free, high-quality resources can make a significant impact on the accessibility of health sciences education at STCC and that by providing professional development opportunities for STCC health sciences faculty, interest in free/open resources will increase, resulting in more courses with zero textbook costs.

10708	10000.0	Addiction Awareness and Education Partnership: Outreach to Families Dealing with Substance Use Disorders	Addiction continues to exact a heavy toll on those struggling with it, as well as their families. While there has been a proliferation of addiction-related resources, patients and families may have difficulty finding credible and accurate information regarding effective treatment, support, and clinical knowledge of this disease. The goal of the Addiction Awareness and Education Partnership is to advance awareness of credible health information resources by providing comprehensive information and support to families whose loved one has a substance use disorder (SUD). In collaboration with the Overdose Prevention Fund and the National Library of Medicine (NLM), AAEP will engage with families attending Learn to Cope meetings across Massachusetts by educating them on how to utilize NLM resources as a streamlined way to access trustworthy SUD treatment services and peer-reviewed information.
10711	5000.0	Empathy Learned Through an Extended Medical Education Virtual Reality Project 2019-2020	UNE Library Services will collaborate with the College of Osteopathic Medicine (COM) to compare four virtual reality (VR) experiences related to older adult health with 1st and 2nd year medical students, and focus on analyzing the results. In addition, students in physical therapy, physician assistant, nursing, and other health professions programs will participate in the project. Embodied Labs (EL) technology immerses users into hypothetical situations that provide a first-person perspective on living with aging related diseases to increase understanding and empathy. VR stations will be available at UNE Libraries on both campuses and students will complete virtual reality assignments as part of the curriculum. An intake form to use with faculty will be developed and piloted to improve project workflow. Students will be introduced to information resources that are available from the National Library of Medicine (NLM) related to older adult health, geared to both healthcare providers, and to patients and their families. Pre-assessment and post-assessment tests will help assess studentsâ€™ experiences, including changes in attitude and knowledge, particularly regarding empathy. Early results from the first 2.5 years of the project show that the VR experiences help increase understanding and empathy in students learning to be health care providers. However, complete data analysis and interpretation has not yet been accomplished. With a fourth grant, it is expected that continuing the project and analyzing the data will provide definitive evidence of the VR projectâ€™s efficacy, thereby supporting a model of person-centered care that is comprehensive and empathetic toward older adult patients.
10714	4124.0	Science Education through Video Recordings from New England Science Boot Camp for Librarians 2019	For ten years the New England Science Boot Camp (SBC) event has been promoting science literacy among librarians in the Northeast. This is an immersive, two-and-a-half-day event that regularly draws between fifty-five and seventy librarians. One of the ways we promote science literacy is by recording the presentations at Camp and creating interesting and watchable educational videos for both attendees and non-attendees to access after the boot camp event. This post-camp educational component is expensive and is performed by a professional videographer who creates a series of web-accessible products to be made available on YouTube.
10717	9875.0	Using Machine Learning to Assess Critical Thinking Skills Related to Health and Nutrition	Critical thinking (CT) skills, such as ability to analyze information, form logical conclusions, and problem solve, are essential for students and measure for educational outcomes because they demonstrate that students can consider facts, recognize gaps in evidence, and evaluate choices when making decisions (Gambrill, 2006). With this in mind, researchers at the University of Rhode Island developed and implemented an online critical thinking development and assessment program in introductory nutrition and agricultural science courses. While this has shown promise, implementation is limited by its reliance on human-scorers. To address this our proposal will test the viability of automated assessment. Utilizing data gathered from the current online program we will test a range of natural language processing (NPL) approaches and compare the results to those of the human-scorers.

10756	4748.0	Meeting the Needs of People in Crisis at the Boston Public Library	Patrons in crisis often turn to the public library as a space for support in finding health and social services resources. Boston Public Library actively meets the needs of a variety of people in  crisis, including those experiencing homelessness, people suffering from substance abuse, and survivors of domestic violence, for example. To address these various service needs, Boston Public Library made changes to staffing and hired a social worker. The goal of this project is to help further address these service challenges by identifying specific needs of these user groups and ways in which staff can engage with them. The project consists of two phases. This first is a series of focus groups designed at examining ways in which library staff can build service capacity and engage with patrons in crisis. The second phase involves building on identification of department and branch service issues to develop workshops designed to help address the concerns identified by staff. In particular, these will focus on providing training on topics such as mental health first aid, responding to substance abuse, and a workshop on using MedlinePlus.
10759	25000.0	Promoting Health Literacy to Influence Health and Wellness of Students in the Community 2018-2019	The Massachusetts Action Coalition (MAAC), which is co-led by the Organization of Nurse Leaders (ONL) and part of a national campaign to build a culture of health across the nation, proposes to develop and implement an initiative to promote health literacy and overall health and wellness of students in selected communities. In this phased project, we intend to utilize the existing structure of School Wellness Committees (SWC), which are mandated by M.G.L. c.111, Â§233, 105 CMR 215.000 to establish standards for School Wellness Advisory Committees in each school district in the Commonwealth under the Department of Public Health (DPH) regulations, as the venue in which we plan to increase and strengthen nursing representation to influence school polices addressing school nutrition, physical activity and related health issues that impact student health as identified by the community. The initiative would pilot an innovative collaboration between the MAAC nurses with the National Library of Medicine (NLM) and the Massachusetts Health Council (MHC) both of which provide an impressive list of educational resources that the nurses will access and use in developing educational programming to increase awareness and offer the resources to the SWC members, who in turn, will use those to develop their student education and the school health program. Over the first year there will be three cycles of engagement with increasing numbers of nurses, SWC members and students that has potential for eventual spread across the state. The impact of this initiative fully supports the NLM goals to increase awareness of the NLM information resources, build a reputation as the primary resource for reliable and authentic content, the provision of training in the use of medical information resources and in using collaborative partnerships to strengthen the connectivity for health.

11285	5000.0	Technology Improvement: ASSIST Laptops for Neighbors Helping Neighbors	The goal of the project is to obtain extra laptops so the ASSIST Volunteers, as well as the Community Resource Partners, will have the ability to connect more Care Receivers to community resources using technology that they may be unable to afford or navigate on their own. In this way, ASSIST can increase their effectiveness in their outreach to the needy in rural Flathead County.  The main audience to benefit from our proposed technology improvements will be the Care Receivers. Care Receivers are previous patients who have been discharged from the hospital and are now in their home. They are connected with resources to help regain their health and independence, but many available resources require internet services which they typically do not have. Increasing the number of laptops and connection to internet services by the ASSIST Volunteers will increase the number of Care Receivers receiving resources.  Care Receiversâ€™ health information needs vary based upon the nature of their diagnosis and recovery plan. The two Medical Librarians will provide two group training sessions to educate staff and volunteers regarding online resources and how to access those resources, focusing on Pharmacy &amp; Supplements and Social Determinant of Health Resources. The Medical Librarians will also participate in monthly multidisciplinary ASSIST team meetings to suggest appropriate online resources for the case(s) being discussed.

11853	12000.0	Reshaping a Health Information Clearinghouse to Improve User Experience and Outcomes of Rural Primary Healthcare Providers	"This proposal reflects a partnership between the Savitt Medical Library at the University of  Nevada, Reno, and the Office of Statewide Initiatives, University of Nevada, Reno, School of  Medicine. The overarching aim of the proposal is to apply the expertise of professional health sciences librarians in order to improve access to health information resources, and to increase rural healthcare professionalsâ€™ engagement with curated online clinical educational materials. The  focus of this effort is a health information clearinghouse that was developed as part of the successful Project ECHO Nevada implementation of videoconference- based clinics. Providing primary care providers with access to subject expertise and an online clearinghouse of resources allows them to deliver much-needed specialty care to their patients. Project ECHO Nevada bridges divides within the provider community and makes medical expertise shared and distributed more widely. We intend to optimize the impact of the Project ECHO Nevada clearinghouse by creating a more intuitive navigation architecture; facilitating discovery of content through enriched annotation and descriptive indexing; and identifying new content to support trending health concerns such as opioid prescribing practices and addiction management.

Specific Objectives
* Conduct a needs assessment of rural health care professionalsâ€™ information seeking habits and interactions with the Project ECHO Nevada information clearinghouse.
* Conduct a detailed audit of all content, including clinic recordings, slide presentations, and related health information resources available through the Project ECHO Nevada information 
clearinghouse to identify areas for enhancements with respect to information architecture, content, navigation, subject indexing, and annotation of resources.
* Develop and implement enhancements to the existing clearinghouse to better align content and linked resources with the needs of rural healthcare personnel.
* Promote awareness and use among rural health professionals of online resources available through the National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease 
Control, Savitt Medical Library, and other relevant organizations through a program of webinars and online tutorials.
* Facilitate document delivery requests through the Savitt Medical Library of the University of Nevada, Reno, School of Medicine."
11856	12000.0	REACH: Resources, Education, and Access for Community Health	"In the Show Low, AZ, region there are barriers in receiving relevant, factual information that relates to overall health and wellness. Those barriers primarily exist due to a lack of internet connectivity, access to computers or mobile devices or lack of knowledge on where to find relevant health information. Show Low Public Library proposes to provide solutions to these barriers by: providing a health information kiosk with access to the National Network of Libraries of Medicine resources along with other quality health information resources in the library next to our Healthy Living Section, along with several mobile iPad kiosks to use in our existing outreach programs. We also propose to elevate our Healthy Living program by increasing services in outreach to include additional health and wellness programs. We currently visit two assisted living/memory care facilities monthly and provide memory care activities to residents. As part of the REACH project, our library will be able to extend the services we currently offer to include using the kiosks to help residents access information, provide more interactive activities to help increase stimulation both mentally and physically, and to educate caregivers. We anticipate that there will be 10,000 to 12,000 kiosk users during the project period.

The goal of this project is to provide resources, education and access to the Show Low community that currently are not available in the areas that we are targeting (e.g., assisted living facilities). Adding a dedicated information kiosk to the library would make access to information easier and more convenient. Moreover, having mobile kiosks at assisted living facilities would provide a much-needed service to an audience that currently does not receive it. Our objective is to provide a more well-rounded program that includes technology, information access and interaction regarding health, emotional and physical well-being. NLM resources to be highlighted during the project include MedlinePlus and resources featured in the Food for Thought NNLM course."

We seek to engage students from underrepresented populations and in areas of highest need. Our pilot project will target first-generation, and economically disadvantaged middle school, high school, and undergraduate students in Henderson, Boulder City, Las Vegas, North Las Vegas, and surrounding areas, beginning in the spring 2019 and continuing throughout the award year. To this end, we will collaborate with the TUN Office of Admissions and present at TUN-sponsored academies, fairs, open houses, workshops, and other events geared towards prospective students and applicants. Our goal is to spark prospective studentsâ€™ interest in medical and health sciences careers through the use of virtual reality (VR) and 3D technologies, with a focus on anatomy, basic sciences, and clinical sciences software programs.

In addition, National Library of Medicine (NLM) databases, such as MedlinePlus and PubMed, will be highlighted in order to increase awareness of health information resources for health professionals, and to better integrate the role of libraries in health professions education and training. NLM database presentations and medical software demonstrations will be led by health sciences librarians, learning specialists within OASIS, anatomy and clinical simulation faculty and staff, and high school liaisons. Additional support will be available as needed from our information systems staff.

Specific Goals
* Goal #1: To improve access to high-quality health professions information for prospective medical and health sciences students.
Objective: Participate in TUN Admissions academies, fairs, open houses, and other events, and offer sessions on â€œlocating high quality health information for health professions students,â€ along with demonstrations on the use of VR and 3D technologies in healthcare education and practice.
* Goal #2: To increase awareness about the resources and services of the National Library of Medicine.
Objective: Develop a TUN Health Professions Information Libguide that will provide convenient access to high quality health information developed by the National Library of Medicine (NLM), and provide information for prospective and matriculating health sciences students on NLM resources, such as PubMed and MedlinePlus.
* Goal #3: To promote, and improve, access to, medical and health information in support of education, research, and patient care.
Objective: Select and obtain VR headsets, medical and health sciences software, and 3D printing and scanning machines, in order to demonstrate their application in medical and health sciences education, research, and patient care."
11887	1284.0	JABSOM Library Collections Development Project	"The goal of this project is to build a collection of graphic medicine novels for community outreach to a nearby local homeless shelter and to enrich the education of medical students, physicians, and patients. Effective communication is achieved through what Michael J. Green and Kimberly Myers call graphic pathography, personal narratives describing the experience of being ill. Like other forms of fiction, they encourage empathy and lessen feelings of isolation in the reader. In addition, the combination of pictures and text increases recall of information, perhaps because it engages multiple parts of the brain. In the past, the Health Sciences Library has focused primarily on collecting only academic materials. The shift to collect non-academic materials serves as a means to make health information more accessible and to connect with the community in new ways.

Outreach goals:
1.    Conduct information sessions for JABSOM faculty, students, and staff to highlight the graphic medicine novels and to feature NLM Resources such as MedlinePlus and the NLM digital collection to show our medical community of new ways to connect with patients
2.    Facilitate health literacy outreach at a nearby local homeless shelter "
11972	49993.0	Mino Izhiwebzi	Mino Izhiwebzi (â€œGood Healthâ€) serves Native Americans (Ojibwe) Elders of the Bois Forte Band of Chippewa. With MedlinePlus as its core resource, Mino Izhiwebzi uses a multifaceted approach to address chronic disease management and improved wellness among Elders by fostering: 1) health literacy and patient empowerment, 2) nutrition and wellness awareness, and 3) intergenerational bonding and learning. Native Americans in Minnesota experience the greatest health disparities in the nation; their life expectancy is a full 11 years less than the stateâ€™s white population. While elderly individuals in all communities are at high risk for poor health, the weight of the multiple social determinants of health borne by Native American Elders adversely impacts their health earlier and with greater intensity. Elder health services are most effective when designed using an understanding of cultural world views, beliefs, and community history. Mino Izhiwebziâ€™s activities are developed and delivered by community health educators and care providers; they are community-based, culturally-responsive and tailored to the specific needs of Bois Forte Elders. Services center on monthly Elder gatherings addressing chronic health maintenance. Gatherings combine learning and socialization, known to promote longevity and improve health among elderly. Health-based games and cultural arts and crafts help maintain mental acuity and hand dexterity while stimulating socialization and sustaining interest in participation. Healthful eating is encouraged with MedlinePlus nutrition information and recipes. These, along with in-kind support, provide for healthy meals that highlight nutritious, flavorful foods. The ease of integrating movement and stress management everyday includes short walks, stretching or one-minute breathing exercises. Regular physical activity and seeking out health information using MedlinePlus is encouraged by earning points to exchange for health-related items such as cookbooks and window-sill herb gardens. Mino Izhiwebzi fosters improved health among young people through their inclusion in intergenerational learning during selected gatherings. These experiences provide opportunities for the fulfillment of critical cultural roles and nurture the beneficial give and take that is part of the Ojibwe cultural norm of intergenerational care as both children and Elders invest in their own health and support one anotherâ€™s. 
11975	49986.0	Health Online: Finding Information You Can Trust â€“ Phase II	â€œHealth Online: Finding Information You Can Trustâ€ will continue to help persons from underrepresented populations better access, identify, and use reliable health information on the internet. With todayâ€™s focus on obtaining information online or going mobile, there is a digital divide for many individuals with low health literacy and represented among vulnerable populations, using online and other digital tools for health (Pew, 2015). Through this project, Wisconsin Health Literacy (WHL) will offer an additional 25 â€œdigital health literacyâ€ workshops for consumers most at risk for low health literacy, especially targeting refugees, immigrants, indigenous peoples, LGBT communities and those with low literacy. WHL uses a proven workshop model which relies on partnership with local organizations to reach vulnerable populations through educational programs offered in trusted settings. WHL will leverage its past experience conducting 32 collaborative Health Online workshops and 4 Health Online training sessions to improve educational content and expand service delivery in new communities across Wisconsin. Community partners are scattered across the state and will include non-profit literacy councils, 75 of which are members of Wisconsin Literacy. Additional historic partners include public libraries, Indian tribes, refugee and immigrant service organizations, seniors, and community health centers. In phase one, we spent time developing materials and reached out primarily through library partners. In this phase, we will insure more targeted delivery by developing new relationships between local libraries and targeted vulnerable populations such as LGBT communities, refugees, immigrants, and indigenous nations (see letters of support and note that additional letters are still coming in from partners and will be shared). A lesson learned from phase one was that there is an increased demand for this type of training for librarians. A second project component involves providing 10 train-the-trainer workshops for librarians, who work with vulnerable populations, on how to effectively help persons with low health literacy find trustworthy health information. This will enhance sustainability and assist librarians to feel more confident in helping all library customers seeking health information, especially those who have lower health literacy and less online expertise. 
11978	9828.0	Gathering Welcome: Creating a Curriculum to Teach Health Literacy to Immigrant and Refugee Women	Margaret Zimmerman, an Assistant Professor with the University of Iowaâ€™s (UI) School of Library and Information Science (SLIS) requests a grant for a second iteration of her pilot program to develop and implement a health literacy training for immigrant and refugee women living in Johnson and Linn counties in Iowa. This grant will build upon Dr. Zimmermanâ€™s current successful project employing SLIS graduate students to deliver a health literacy course to immigrant and refugee women. Based upon the findings of the current pilot, Dr. Zimmerman will develop a formal, more extensive curriculum with the assistance of a graduate student in curriculum development from the College of Education. Dr. Zimmerman will utilize collaborators from the Obermann Center Public Engagement Working Group, of which she is co-director, and from the School of Public Health. The new curriculum will be tested through delivery to the target population by SLIS students, encouraging them to understand the challenges of meeting the needs of traditionally underserved individuals and promoting the NLMâ€™s consumer health information resources. The result of this project will be a cohesive, vetted curriculum designed to improve the health literacy and health information access and outcomes of immigrants and refugees. This outcome supports the mission of the NNLM by improving a traditionally underserved communityâ€™s access to information, and therefore enabling them to make informed decisions about their health. Similarly, it supports the aims of the GMR by providing access to quality health information for consumers, and developing and implementing an outreach and education program that focuses on an underserved health community. This project will also assist with the aim of improving GMR consumerâ€™s understanding of quality health information resources available online so to aid in medical decision-making. This resultant educational intervention has the potential to improve the health literacy and address the health informational needs of refugee women and their families. While the immediate impact will be on refugee women participating in the pilot program, this project is meant to create replicable programming for other community organizations and has the additional benefit of engaging SLIS students with traditionally underserved communities using NLM resources. 
12011	11516.0	Iowa Public Health Research Center (IPHRC) at Allen College - Phase II	"Allen College, UnityPoint Health is a regionally-accredited, private, nonprofit institution of higher education located in Waterloo, Iowa. Built on a tradition of more than 90 years of healthcare education, Allen currently serves 661 students in eight health programs ranging from associates to doctoratesâ€”nursing, public health, radiography, sonography, medical laboratory science, medical imaging, occupational therapy, and health education. 
    
Across Iowa and the nation, health professionals in public health departments and government funded non-profits must continuously address emerging epidemics and manage ongoing issues in order to solve community health problems. However, these health professionals have historically lacked access to the latest research and evidence-based-practices on these topics. Moreover, they often lack the time or expertise to navigate the information available. 
    
In 2018, Allen Collegeâ€™s library and public health departments combined forces to create the Iowa Public Health Research Center (IPHRC). The IPHRC aims to link the stateâ€™s healthcare and public health professionals with no-cost research access and assistance. 
    
The IPHRC operates out of Allen Collegeâ€™s Barrett Library, which is a premier repository of biomedical and health information. The library provides access to over 33,500 materials including 47 databases, 3,200 online journals, 3,100 streaming videos, and over 12,500 physical texts. In addition, the project provides the following services:     
   â€¢ Supply digital items through e-mail and loan physical items by mail 
   â€¢ Provide specific articles or essays, located behind paywalls 
   â€¢ Conduct searches and provide summaries of relevant sources 
   â€¢ Locate research data to help participants create a presentation or report 
   â€¢ Share patient materials for a specific issue or audience (non-native speakers, low reading comprehension, etc.) 
   â€¢ Deliver training on how to use the Allen College Library as well as health databases such as PubMed, MedlinePlus, HealthReach, DailyMed, and Clinical eCompanion. 
    
The IPHRC library researcher will be available throughout the grant period to respond to item requests; locate, assess, and share resources; produce literature reviews; and collaborate with healthcare professionals to find the best solutions for their needs. Grant participants will be able to visit the library in person during regular operating hours or submit an online request through the IPHRC webpage twenty-four hours a day.

12020	15736.0	Healthy Communities in Fulton County, Illinois (HCFCI)	The Healthy Communities in Fulton County, Illinois (HCFCI) project is a collaboration between the University of Illinois at Chicagoâ€™s Library of the Health Sciences in Peoria (UIC LHSP), the Western Illinois Universityâ€™s School of Nursing (WIU SON), and public libraries in Fulton County. In this project, librarians, nursing professors, and nursing students will work with public libraries to provide health fairs for the public. A health sciences librarian will also provide information and training to public librarians and library staff and create an HCFCI online portal to provide an easy consolidated access point to NLM resources and programs. The health fairs will assess blood pressure and BMI for attending members of the public and will provide information and education about heart disease, health literacy, the National Institute of Healthâ€™s (NIHâ€™s) All Of Us program, and the National Library of Medicine&#039;s (NLM&#039;s) reliable information resources. The public library training will be based on the Stand Up for Health materials available through the National Network of Libraries of Medicine (NNLM). Additionally, each participating public library will receive a health literacy kit, which will include materials available from the NNLM along with display stands and consumer health books for their collection. 
12031	6380.0	Awareness August	"Twinsburg Public Library will host three speaker programs and share posts on social media including Facebook and Pinterest in the month of August to help focus on three issues that have impacted the community: addiction, child welfare &amp; online behavior, and vaccinations. The goal of these programs and post will be to provide quality information for the community, with a highlight on MedlinePlus and PubMed. Each â€œawarenessâ€ social post will also include a link to an NLM resource. 
    
At the start of each program, the librarian host will conduct an ice-breaker, before the introduction of the speaker(s). During the icebreaker, the library will give a brief explanation about trustworthy health sources online and demonstrate how to access the MedlinePlus and PubMed resources. At the end of each program, the library would like to make the following available to participants: (1) â€œDrugs, Brains, and Behavior: The Science of Addiction&quot; by NIDA, (2) â€œProtecting your Child from Sexual Abuseâ€ by Elizabeth Jeglic and Cynthia Calkins. &amp; â€œCreepy Street: Spider on the Webâ€ by Lee Jordan, and (3) â€œCalling the Shotsâ€ DVD by NOVA. 
    
The NIDA publication was selected due to the accessible writing and authoritative source. â€œCalling the Shotsâ€ was selected specifically to act against the popular antivaccination documentary, â€œVaxxed.â€ With an hour runtime, and the trusted NOVA as a producer, â€œCalling the Shotsâ€ is also accessible, without being patronizing in tone. â€œProtecting your Child from Sexual Abuseâ€ was selected based on the credentials of Elizabeth Jeglic, who has written in articles for Journal of Forensic Psychology Practice and Sexual Abuse. Both Jeglic and Calkins are psychology professors at John Jay College in New York. The title addresses the exact question that parents have in regards to this specific type of crime. Finally, two librarians read and reviewed the self-published â€œCreepy Street: Spider on the Web.â€ Although the rhyming is not perfect, it does teach children to be careful with what they share (and who they meet) online.

12034	19994.0	Creating Ready-Made Health Education Toolkits 	The Oakland University William Beaumont (OUWB) School of Medicine Medical Library and Auburn Hills Public Library established a health literacy educational outreach partnership in August 2018. Since then, the libraries have partnered to plan, offer, and evaluate a series of pilot programs for children, their parents, and adult library users on various health topics. The programs were developed and implemented by an interdisciplinary team including medical school faculty and staff, medical students, medical librarians, and public librarians. This project seeks to build a sustainable educational program at the Auburn Hills Public Library through the creation of a set of ready-made health education toolkits on various health topics all of which will incorporate National Library of Medicine resources including MedlinePlus, Tox Town, and Household Products Database. These toolkits will include an instructional manual, files, and all supplies needed to offer educational outreach programs focused on improving the local communityâ€™s health knowledge and health information-seeking behavior. Three toolkit types will be created: 1) in-person educational activities for preschool and elementary school children and their parents; 2) in-person educational activities for adults, including the senior population, that will specifically raise awareness of how to access and use National Library of Medicine resources; and 3) circulating health education kits for parents and their children which will promote independent, self-directed learning. The circulating boxes will include educational books, pre-made activities, and educational games in a specific topic area, such as germs, nutrition, and environmental health and will link to relevant National Library of Medicine resources. In order to create the toolkits, funding will cover personnel costs to develop the activities with an instructional designer, epidemiologist, and medical librarians and also purchase the toolkit supplies including technology, books, and educational games. The program will be evaluated several ways including in-person session evaluations, circulation statistics, and facilitator observations. 
12037	20000.0	The Interactive County-Level FAIR Health Data Web Tool for Librarians & Health Professionals Initiative 	The Interactive County-Level Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) Health Data Web Tool for Librarians &amp; Health Professionals Initiative will consist of 4 phases to establish and sustain an interactive web tool for librarians and local health professionals to access FAIR local community health assessment data. The purpose of this web tool is to provide librarians and local health professionals with a simple to operate and easy to understand user interface that utilizes raw county-level health data we have organized in our cloud-based database (Amazon Aurora). To help librarians and local health professionals better understand and utilize this data to help inform county-level health initiatives and resolve health disparities, our solution is to provide these individuals with a user-friendly interface that provides them with interactive data visualizations that generate summary statistics and health trends from county-level health assessment data. Phase 1 of this proposed project will be to develop an analytical plan and produce the analysis tables for import from the Amazon Aurora database in the data visualization platform, Tableau. Phase 2 will consist of updating the Amazon Aurora database schema and importing the analyzed data tables in Tableau. Phase 3 will consist of the refinement of the interactive tools embedded in Tableau and finalize web development items that allow us to easily integrate the user-friendly data visualization selection options and dashboards onto the Richland Public Health website. Finally, Phase 4 will provide webinars to Richland County as well as 12 rural North Central Ohio Counties in an effort to educate their local health professionals and librarians about the interactive web tool, how utilizing this resource can inform their local health programming efforts, and how they can help further contribute to the data that is collected and analyzed in the Interactive County-Level FAIR Health Data Web Tool for Librarians &amp; Health Professionals Initiative. 
12046	20000.0	Understanding Rates of Attrition in Biomedical Data Challenges: A Study of Failure 	Biomedical data challenges are interdisciplinary live or virtual competitive events that require participants to analyze big biomedical data and develop prototype solutions to real-world problems that accelerate innovation of medical applications, improve healthcare technology design, and help streamline healthcare business models (Wang, et al., 2018). Participation in biomedical data challenges helps current and future health professionals identify, consider, and develop solutions to challenges associated with how big biomedical data influences patient well-being, and data challenges are particularly useful for illustrating issues associated with the underuse of uniform data standards and with navigating siloed data. However, data challenges are often criticized for promoting a culture unwelcoming to women and underrepresented minorities by fostering an overly competitive environment; for using a format that potential participants might find unappealing--i.e. staying up for days on end; and for lacking in diversity, which leads to feelings of otherness (Decker, et al., 2015). In 2016, Purdue University Libraries launched the Biomedical Big Data Hacking for Civic Health Awareness Project to help alleviate these issues by offering inclusive biomedical data challenges that leverage current interest in data competitions and extend that appeal to members of groups commonly underrepresented in data challenges. The project has succeeded in its goal. Across its 2.5 years of offering data challenges, 28% of total participants have been either health professionals or students majoring in a health sciences discipline, 38% of attendees have been women, and 46% have been members of a racial minority group. However, the project has seen a high rate of attrition amongst the number of participants who register for the challenges and the number of participants who submit final projects. Similar rates of attrition have been observed amongst participants in other data challenges, for example, in business case competitions where participants are tasked with analyzing health-related data to develop a marketing plan. As the Biomedical Big Data Hacking for Civic Health Awareness Project continues, we seek to understand the success factors that motivate students to complete data challenges and to understand what factors lead to failure, in hopes of improving attrition rates.

12110	10000.0	High School Education Day for Substance Abuse Prevention	Wright State University (WSU) librarians, along with faculty and graduate students from the Boonshoft School of Medicine (BSOM) and College of Education and Human Services (CEHS), will partner with local high schools to deliver substance abuse education and health literacy instruction to the students in six area high schools. A full-day, interactive curriculum will be provided to students on the WSU campus and will use NLM resources to support students in learning how to make healthy choices and be drug free. The target audience for this educational event is students in grades 11-12 from local underrepresented high schools. Students from area high schools will be invited to the WSU main campus for a full day of active learning that will empower them to be able to advocate for healthy and drug-free choices using library research and health literacy skills. WSU librarians and staff from the BSOM and CEHS will each oversee a module of instruction that supports students in learning about aspects of addiction. In module 1, students will learn how to locate and evaluate health information for credibility and quality (WSU libraries). In module 2, students will learn about the neurobiology of addiction (BSOM). In module 3, students will learn about the psychosocial elements of addiction (CEHS). In the culminating activity, students will work in groups of four to create a poster based on the evidence they collected and learned from the three modules. The major focus of the poster is to construct a drug-free advocacy message to share with peers. Posters will be scored using a rubric and students who create the top scoring messages will receive a prize. The education day will occur twice during the year with three schools coming to each, resulting in six schools total. We consider these two days to be part of an overall pilot project, with the intention of using our findings to expand the program to support substance abuse and health literacy education in other locations. 
12113	19525.0	Dementia & â€œAll of Usâ€ Research Awareness Project for Public Libraries	The Dementia &amp; â€œAll of Usâ€ Research Awareness project embodies the NNLM â€œAll of Usâ€ Public Library Partnership Award mission in two vital ways. One, by focusing on one group of underserved individuals that libraries are just beginning to serveâ€¦ those living with dementia and their care partnersâ€¦ the project promotes the use of public libraries to support community health information needs through the use of National Library of Medicine and other quality health education resources. Stigma about dementia often keeps people from seeking diagnosis and treatment; it also precipitates withdrawal from favorite activities and places due to a lack of acceptance. The public library can help to counteract this stigma while increasing community participation by assisting the public to learn more about dementia and by welcoming this group of too-often forgotten people into their facilities. Accordingly, Library staff and trustees would benefit from additional training about the disease and about supportive strategies for interacting with people living with dementia. Accordingly, the proposal includes an introduction to NLM dementia resources and a dementia awareness curriculum that includes definition and characteristics of dementia as well as an introduction to general communication, library-specific, and environmental strategies that support people with dementia and their care partners. In-person curriculum-based training will be delivered at ten (10) diverse public libraries in northeastern Illinois, southern Illinois, and southeastern Wisconsin as well as two (2) urban communities identified in the 2018-2019 GMR NNLM Ambassador program. One onsite training session will be videotaped and posted online for later access; two training sessions will be made available via free live webinars and archived for later viewing. Sustainability will be created via online resources and a train-the-trainer program involving partnering Illinois and Wisconsin libraries. Two, because Alzheimerâ€™s disease and related dementias affect a diverse, substantial, and growing population, the projectâ€™s focus on dementia presents an excellent opportunity for increased public and participant awareness and understanding of the NIH All of Us Research Program. All trainings and partnering libraries will promote and/or share the research program via dementia literacy, health programs, and materials on-site and through affiliated libraries and community organizations.
12121	15301.0	Leadership Training of Iowa Families of Children and Youth with Special Healthcare Needs (CYSHCN) To Promote Self-Efficacy 	The Iowa Family Leadership Training Institute (IFLTI) is a four-session, in-person training designed to develop the leadership skills of emerging family leaders who are parents of Iowa children and youth with special health care needs (CYSHCN). The IFLTI is sponsored by the University of Iowa Division of Child and Community Health, which also oversees Child Health Specialty Clinics (CHSC), Iowaâ€™s Maternal and Child Health Title V Program for CYSHCN. Now in its fourth year, the IFLTI was created in 2016 by families of CYSHCN for families of CYSHCN. The purpose of the training is to equip parents and primary caregivers of CYSHCN to: partner more effectively with medical providers, schools, and community systems; identify gaps in the System of Care for CYSHCN, and; create Community Service Projects to address those gaps. IFLTI trainers are three Family Navigators, parents of CYSHCN employed by the Division. In addition to the four-session, in-person sessions, this project will also include the delivery of 1-2 training modules during evening or weekend sessions to families in underserved areas of Iowa. The serial nature of the IFLTI curriculum, while conducive to team building and in-depth learning, is a barrier to families who do not have flexible work schedules and easy access to child care, so for  those unable to travel to the training, the training will go to them. Since 2017, information about National Network of Libraries of Medicine (NNLM) resources has been included in the training, presented by members of the NNLM Greater Midwest Region staff.  This new knowledge has enlightened and empowered training participants to seek evidence-based materials for themselves and their communities. This application is to support the spring 2019 IFLTI session to train 12 parents or primary caregivers of CYSCHN, including two diverse parents, and three regional trainings to be held in fall of 2019.
12305	3036.0	Promoting Heart Health in the Library	During the grant period, the Library will create and implement the Treat Yourself program. Treat Yourself, even in its title, combines our patronsâ€™ desires to become healthier with the super popular lens of self-care &amp; wellness. The six-week program will consist of a combination of yoga classes and group walking sessions that help patrons de-stress, take time for themselves, and meet new people through social interactions. In addition, participants will learn skills, including deep breathing exercises, that can help them maintain their heart &amp; mental health while empowering them to make healthier, holistic choices. Participants will walk away from the program with newfound goals, knowledge, accountability partners, and walking routines â€“ a toolkit of healthy resources they can take with them anywhere. They will also receive an introduction to the National Library of Medicine&#039;s MedlinePlus.
12334	29754.0	Building Usage of Public Libraries as a Source of Health Information in Five Diverse Utah Communities	"Our ultimate goal is to develop a model(s) for building public library-community collaborations with diverse racial/ethnic/cultural communities which support community usage of libraries and library programs as sources for health information. We define â€œhealthâ€ as the Seven Domains of Health â€“ physical, emotional, environmental, social, intellectual, financial, and spiritual. 

As the first step toward this goal, we held Community Engagement Studios with community â€œexpertsâ€ from each community; these individuals are experts by virtue of their lived experience and participated in the Community Engagement Studios as consultants. The communities within the Salt Lake City area identified for CE Studios included the African immigrant/refugee community, African American community, Hispanic/Latino community, Pacific Islander community, and the American Indian/Alaskan Native community. We also held a CE Studio consultation with librarians from libraries in the areas where these community members live. Finally, we held a workshop with representatives of community organizations and the librarians to discuss the findings from the CE Studios and to draft a plan for increasing usage of public libraries and library programs as sources for health information by members of the communities."
12346	235.0	Impostor syndrome and how to manage it program	The St. Louis Medical Librarians Association requested a grant award in the amount of $235 to provide a program on impostor syndrome for the librarian community in St. Louis, Missouri.

12746	18999.0	Critical Appraisal Institute for Librarians	The purpose of this project will be to create and establish a symposium to develop high level critical appraisal skills in librarians who work with health care information. Many health sciences librarians provide evidence based medicine (EBM) training at their home institutions. For most their involvement in this training is limited to training: asking questions (PICO); searching resources; and only a rudimentary coverage of critical appraisal of clinical information. The ultimate goal of this symposium will be to enhance the abilities of health sciences librarians to take EBM training to the next level - to develop competencies in biomedical statistics, scientific methodology, and clinical decision making; and to enhance confidence and comfort of librarians in teaching the concepts of critical appraisal. The intention of the planning group is to use this year to plan and prepare for an institute which will be offered as a virtual pilot in Spring 2019.

In the revision process with the three selected individuals, volunteers from communities will participate in audience testing to provide feedback on the revisions. This will ensure the materials are as understandable and appropriate as possible while also providing the volunteer interviewers with training and experience necessary for conducting audience testing.
12855	40000.0	Learning Lounge Sandbox: Designing Resources, Services, and Curriculum to Advance Health Literacy Needs	Dell Medical School, which opened in June 2016, is charting new ground when it comes to developing value-based models of care. The school has made a commitment to improve the health outcomes of the community it serves and to reach beyond traditional health care models to identify and address the social determinants of health. The Design Institute for Health has created a library space, called the learning lounge, in the Health Transformation Building (HTB) to enable a wide array of new learning opportunities for the population served by the health clinics in the HTB and around the medical campus. Together with Dell Medâ€™s Librarian, the Design Institute has brought together consumer health material (eg. books and magazines) for use in the library space which has a variety of seating, a tablet computer, two 52-inch display screens, indoor and outdoor seating areas, and free pervasive Wi-Fi. During the first year of operation, we would like to focus our program of work at the intersection of health and technology literacy. This library space will be a sandbox in which to develop new health literacy programming including the on-boarding and training of people on mobile health applications, the developing of new ways to communicate health information, and the guiding of people to relevant sources of health information.
12860	24985.0	Mobile Systems Education and Resources for Consumer Health (MSEARCH) 2018 	Mobile Systems Education and Resources for Consumer Health (MSEARCH) 2018 is an electronic skill building program focused on educating seniors in Harris County on how to navigate National Libraries of Medicine (NLM) health information resources using mobile device technology. The program will address the information-seeking needs of seniors while providing ready access to NLM online information resources. This program is an expansion of several previous MSEARCH programs that were developed and successfully implemented by the Greater Houston Area Health Education Center (GHAHEC) at eleven community centers since. As a result of the program, approximately 220 seniors learned basic mobile tablet device skills and were introduced to the NIHSeniorHealth.gov, Go4Life.gov and MedlinePlus.gov websites. The MSEARCH 2018 program will be carried out using a similar methodology. The target population will be reached at three centralized senior centers throughout Houston, Harris County. The program curriculum will incorporate lessons covering tools available on MedlinePlus.gov, nia.nih.gov/health, and Go4Life.gov websites. We will teach M-SEARCH 2018 Project (Mobile Systems Education and Resources for Consumer Health) the curriculum to approximately fifteen to twenty seniors and at least one staff member at each location. For optimal results, we will partner with Baker-Ripley Neighborhood Centers, Inc., formerly Neighborhood Centers Inc., to access the target population. The agency will support the project by providing classroom space and wireless Internet access at each of its affiliated senior centers to attract participants throughout the Houston area. GHAHEC will purchase 30 mobile tablet devices to accommodate the learning needs of older adults. In addition, upon program graduation, each training location will receive one desktop computer to set-up for public Internet access. It is our desire to motivate participation in the program and empower seniors to take a more active role in their healthcare.
12865	24982.0	Preparing Arkansas Patient Educators and Nurse Educators to Use Authoritative Consumer Health Resources	This project will create a consumer health resources course with nursing continuing education credit paired with an online guide to train nursing and patient educators to find, evaluate, and use reliable consumer health and genetics resources. The course and online guide will be piloted at the local hospitals including the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) during the first half of the award period, allowing for updates and revisions. Then the course will be taught to nurse and patient educators in hospitals and clinics throughout the state. The course on consumer health resources will be targeted at nursing and patient educators in a Train the Trainer model. We will also be introducing basic genetics information sites which will lay the groundwork for the combined National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Library of Medicine (NLM) All of Us research project. This will bring NLM and other reliable consumer health resources to the attention of patient and nurse educators that can then be passed directly on to patients. Taking the consumer health resources course to different parts of the state to work with nurse and patient educators will have the benefit of bringing consumer health resources to the hospitals and clinics where educators can distribute the information to many patients.
12868	4550.0	Better Technology, Better Physicians	The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) requires each institution with a graduate medical education training program to make available adequate resources for fellow education. For nephrology training programs, a meeting room with visual and other educational aids is required. The nephrology fellowship program offers didactic sessions to the fellows in a conference room without a TV, and a small whiteboard for projection. With a wall-mounted, large screen smart TV, didactic sessions can include web-based instruction (including NLM tutorials on EBM, PubMed/MEDLINE, and literature appraisal) and videoconferencing. 
12871	9692.0	Training for practice in rural and underserved areas using NLM databases and virtual reality technology	Stated in the mission and goals of the Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine (ARCOM) is the desire to recruit and train medical students who are focused on service to the underserved. This aim is important because Arkansas is one of the lowest ranking states in physician-to-population ratio. With over 80% of medical students who complete both their undergraduate medical education and graduate medical education in Arkansas staying in the state to practice, ARCOM strives to prepare its students to work in rural and underserved areas of the state and help improve our stateâ€™s physician shortage. To give our students the best training possible, the goal of this project is twofold. First, because healthcare settings in rural and underserved areas may not have access to expensive subscription health information resources, we will train our students to search PubMed and other NLM databases to locate quality biomedical and clinical information, and to use MedlinePlus and HealthReach for patient education materials to support effective doctor-patient communication and improve patient compliance. These NLM resources are invaluable because they offer high quality, full text health information free of cost. Second, we will cultivate and reinforce empathy in our students toward the populations they will serve through VR software developed by Embodied Labs, a company that creates immersive, interactive VR experiences for health training. This cutting-edge technology creates first-person experiences of various medical conditions and life circumstances that our students will encounter in the field, allowing them to â€œembodyâ€ and experience the world as a patient with a particular condition, such as Alzheimerâ€™s or macular degeneration. Incorporating this training into the first two years of curriculum will better prepare our students for their rotations in the third year, three of which must occur in rural and underserved healthcare settings. In this way, ARCOM not only graduates future physicians who are likely to remain in our mission-specific areas, but who have also had the best training possible to help them serve the underserved with knowledge and compassion.
12876	7500.0	Assessing Library Health Education Programs Targeting Youth	Pioneer Library System offers summer programming experiences across its tri-county service area to engage children in learning during their break from school. During June and July, Pioneerâ€™s public libraries located in Blanchard, Noble, and Tecumseh plan to host health and safety education programs for young children multiple times a week at each location. Children will learn about health and safety from community experts identified from Pioneerâ€™s partnerships with the local health and fire departments, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, the Pioneer Library System and Foundation Board of Directors, school districts, and more. Additionally, many of the children attending the programs reside in lower-income areas and often struggle with hunger during the summer months. This program will provide healthy lunches and education about proper nutrition habits. Through this grant opportunity, Pioneer Library System seeks to hire a contractor with a strong background in health assessment to determine the impact and effectiveness of the programs, as well as to identify potential areas for improvement.
12892	25000.0	Prevention Through Gaming: evaluating the effectiveness of Alcohol and Drug Prevention messages through gaming app	Prevention education of youth is a challenging field, with little evidence on effectiveness. The love of games on phones and iPads is evident in our current society. This application is in support of the development of an alcohol, tobacco and drug prevention game targeted at youth. It will be available for download through the iTunes App store. Other alcohol and drug prevention games are more straight education and scenario-based. In contrast, this project will develop a fun, interactive prototype of a game app that includes prevention messages and has links to help, but will also be fun to play. This is an innovative concept with no apps found that are similar in nature. Through a partnership with a local school district, the game will be downloaded to district-purchased iPads that the students take home. Data will be collected to evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention based on the choices the user makes on the game. Based on those results, the gaming app can be further developed and widely distributed.
12895	9949.0	Updating Website listing Resources for At-Risk Pregnant Women in Dallas County	The Center for Addiction and Recovery Studies (CARS) developed a website using a DSHS grant in 2011 to list resources for pregnant women in Dallas County (www.dallashealthybabies.com). This website is in need of updates and a more engaging / entertaining presentation. It also needs more links to evidenced based healthcare information as found on the National Library of Medicine&#039;s databases. The website provides links to various local resources that can be helpful for pregnant women in Dallas County. CARS will use an advanced graduate Community and Administrative Practice (CAP) social work intern to research current community resources to update this information on the website. In the final months of the project, another CAP student will then help evaluate the upgrades to the website, documenting improvements made and changes in website traffic. This grant will pay for 3 art students under the guidance of 2 Fine Arts professors to work on inputting the updated information and links on the website with an engaging format that will be user-friendly and welcoming to the user. The website is intended to give users in Dallas County or surrounding areas accurate information on pregnancy, fetal development, medical co-occurring disorders, mental health / substance use disorders, where to go for help, how to apply for Medicaid and how to get prenatal care. This website it designed to provide resources and help to all pregnant women in Dallas County, but especially those who have risk factors.
12898	6996.0	Community Assessment - Opioid Crisis, High Risk Pregnancies and Access to Information	The opioid crisis has been well documented. According to the Texas Department of State Health Services, there were 188 births with documented Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) in Dallas County to babies covered by Medicaid. This is 13% of the NAS Medicaid claims for Texas in 2015. There were also 160 opioid-related deaths in 2015 â€“ which is 13.6% of the opioid-related deaths in Dallas County. However, Dallas County accounts for 9% of the Texas population. The Center for Addiction and Recovery Studies (CARS) operates the New Connections Pregnant Postpartum Intervention (PPI) Program which has an emphasis on intervening with high risk pregnancies, especially with pregnant women using opioids. One way we reach pregnant women using opioids is through conducting street outreach, which is giving opioid overdose information, harm reduction kits, hygiene items, pregnancy testing kits and our information out to women in high risk areas of Dallas. However, these efforts have not yielded as high of results as needed. This proposal is to pay for students to assist with a detailed community assessment of targeted areas of Dallas County to determine opioid use, access to services, access to healthcare information, and unmet needs. The community assessment will also include a survey of healthcare services in the identified communities and survey their knowledge of interventions with opioid use disorders and their use on NLM information. This grant is to pay for a Graduate Research Assistant (GRA) to collect data and survey the identified communities with the help of a bachelor&#039;s level student. Then the GRA will continue into the Fall semester to help analyze the data, write a report and fill in any gaps in information.
12902	2993.0	Itâ€™s Opening Day at the JPS Health Network Medical Library	Last year the JPS Health Network Medical Library joined with University of North Texas Health Science Center Library. As the only library network of this type in North Texas, this unique connection allowed staff from both libraries to assess the needs of the hospital library and expand services in a variety of meaningful ways. With new staff and a renovated library space the JPS Health Network Medical Library will cap an exciting year in the summer of 2018. In preparation for this milestone, the Library plans to announce its presence widely to the staff and patients. A standard of accessibility and service will be the hallmark of this new approach to library services. The proposed Opening Day project seeks to utilize funds from the National Network of Libraries of Medicine to generate promotional materials and install technology to ensure easy access to quality health information. The overarching objectives will be accomplished through the use of promotional materials, an opening day event, and the implementation of a library kiosk.
12905	1723.0	The UT Healthier Youth Recipe and Resource Booklet	The UT Health San Antonio Libraries serve as a Resource Library of the National Network of Libraries of Medicine for the South Central area of Texas. The major health concerns facing residents of South Central Texas continue to include diabetes, communicable diseases, cancer, and obesity. It is commonly accepted that health literacy rates remain low in the U.S. population at large but at even lower rates in underserved, Hispanic, and immigrant populations, which are large populations in South Central Texas. Sustainable community engagement leading to lasting collaborations with these populations is vital in order to impact health literacy rates. In 2017, UT Health San Antonio Libraries received an NNLM SCR Express Outreach Award to provide the Youth Health Literacy Challenge, a program in which activity logs and calendars were distributed to youth participating in the North East Independent School District (NEISD) Summer Food Service Program, or Summer Feeding Program, at four San Antonio Public Library (SAPL) branches. For the 2018-2019 funding period, the Libraries seek funding for â€œThe UT Healthier Youth Recipe and Resource Bookletâ€ for a continued partnership with the NEISD Summer Feeding Program at SAPL branches and new partnerships with the UT Teen Health Clinic and the UT Teen Health Youth Leadership Council. The UT Healthier Youth Recipe and Resource Booklet will encourage youth in grades 3-12 to seek health information in a fun and engaging way and bring awareness to NLM and other resources that may influence the practice of healthy behaviors. With input from teens at both SAPL and the UT Teen Health Youth Leadership Council, the booklet will include recipes, games, and information about NLM resources for youth. This project supports one of the UT Health San Antonioâ€™s strategies for achieving its mission, which is to engage the community to improve health.
12908	9955.0	Warrior Kids Health and Wellness Initiative	The Texas A&amp;M University-Central Texas University Library routinely offers programs for children and young adults in support of our local community. Two of the most valuable of these are a summer reading enrichment program and a summer STEM program. The first, a four week summer reading enrichment camp, targets local second and third graders who are reading below grade level, and provides them with a challenging, fun environment to improve reading skills and confidence over the summer. This year, we would like to make health and wellness the theme of the program, because we believe that learning to read and enjoy nonfiction can help impact both reading and science-related learning. The second, a STEM camp, will focus on teaching 4th and 5th graders about the scientific method, scientific inquiry, and scientific research. This is a two week, full-day program, and this year we would like to focus part of it on health- and biology-related topics. We are asking for funds to purchase related library collections and information resources, to acquire supplies and equipment in support of hands-on activities, to hire two students for the summer who will help design and run the health-related curriculum, and indirect costs. Notably, once this content is developed, we will continue to use it in future years for this and other programs. We will also turn some of the curriculum into smaller one-to-two hour programs that target health topics, which will be available to our local ISDs and public libraries for field trips to our campus, or on-site visits from our librarians. Once we have the items, we will reuse them to reach out to as many groups in our community as possible. We would also plan to develop instructions for the NNLM so that other libraries could replicate our efforts, and especially academic libraries.
12911	9305.0	The H.O.P.E. Directory: Bringing Health Organizationâ€™s Programs & Events Together	As a resource library for the National Network of Libraries of Medicine (NNLM), the Gibson D. Lewis Health Science Library is proposing the establishment of a directory of local health organization&#039;s programs and events called the H.O.P.E. Directory. The establishment of this directory will help centralize access to reliable and authoritative local information, raise awareness of the role of resource libraries, and generate collaboration between organizations. The objectives of the project include the creation of a web-based directory using Drupal, the collection of information to populate the directory, promotion to local community-based health organizations along with their patrons and sharing project files widely to generate more H.O.P.E. Directories in other areas. The first year of this project will focus on the collection of data in Tarrant County, followed by surrounding counties in successive years. This project is a part of a long-term strategy for Lewis Library outreach services to become a hub in the North Texas area for connecting the communities and collaborators to quality health information.
12915	10000.0	Connecting Systemic Diseases and Oral Health of Children: Accessible Information to Help Families Understand the Relationship	The goal of this project is to develop accurate health information concerning the effects of systemic diseases on the oral health of children and/or how the oral health of a child can affect the prognosis of a systemic disease, and to make this information available to families in a user-friendly format. Having this information will encourage parents to seek dental care for their children with systemic diseases. Dental health professionals will create this information, written at an appropriate level for a consumer, and build a dynamic website devoted to providing such information. The web site generated by this project will be submitted to the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, American Dental Association, American Dental Education Association, centers for Interprofessional Education, regional Childrenâ€™s Hospitals, MEDLINEPlus.gov, Partners in Information Access for the Public Health Workforce, and HealthReach for consideration of inclusion in their consumer health resources.
12930	40000.0	Health Literacy for New Orleans Hospitality Industry	504HN seeks this opportunity to partner with the National Network of Libraries of Medicine-SCR to impact health literacy in the Greater New Orleans Region. The mission of this partnership would be to promote health literacy and improve the communityâ€™s ability to access to information that enables them to make informed decisions about their health. Currently, 504HN has a special focus on the New Orleans Hospitality Workers. The project will increase access to health information for those in the hospitality industry through transformational capacity-building of the regionâ€™s safety-net health care system. With this special population in mind, 504HN will develop a program that supports a coordinated system of care with two major components: A Community of Practice for health care staff and a community engagement campaign.
12935	40000.0	Is Your WebLitLegit? Helping Teens Discern Health Information Truth from Trash on the Internet	WebLitLegit aims to teach teens to obtain reliable, usable health information from the Internet. Specifically, our project team, in collaboration with teens, will develop a workshop to teach teens how to: 1) Locate reliable health information found on the Internet; 2) Evaluate and distinguish reliable from unreliable health information on the Internet; 3) Effectively use information resources in the context of their own needs or the needs of their peers to make decisions about their health; and 4) Utilize AskMe3, a health care communication technique, to ensure they obtain relevant and needed information from health care providers. To bring the WebLitLegit workshop to where teens are and build sustainability, we will partner with the community, including libraries, schools, Boys and Girls Club, museums and other youth serving venues in the DFW area. Named partners include: Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Tarrant County, Fort Worth Museum of Science and History Research and Learning Center, Cook Children&#039;s, South Garland High School, Children&#039;s Health, and Denton Public Libraries.
12939	39907.0	The GARDEN Project â€“ Growing Access to Resources Directed at Emotional Needs	The GARDEN Project (Growing Access to Resources Directed at Emotional Needs) is a health literacy intervention designed to improve emotional wellness knowledge and related communications skills among adults in rural settings. A team of health literacy experts will engage public health faculty and subject matter experts to develop a guide that will help individuals at various health literacy levels identify emotional wellness needs in themselves or others and develop the communication skills necessary to connect with appropriate sources of care. The guide will be vetted by community representatives, including those with known health literacy challenges. The team will develop facilitator guides and engage an existing network of eager community leaders to disseminate the guides across the state. Formal project evaluation will help us measure the anticipated impacts on knowledge and help-seeking confidence. Final products will be translated into Spanish and field tested by Spanish speakers to ensure successful cultural adaptation. These resources and lessons learned about their community-based implementation can be replicated across the nation as communities seek ways to inform the public about emotional wellness. Named partners include: UAMS College of Public Health, UAMS Library, FAITH Network, Arkansas Department of Health, and Central Arkansas Library System.
12944	5518.0	Healthy Heroes Summer Program	Decatur Public Library has partnered with local fitness and nutrition experts to develop our Healthy Heroes Summer Program 2019. Healthy Heroes combines the power of summer reading with the value of a healthy lifestyle. Rather than focus solely on reading this summer, our Healthy Heroes program will incorporate a fitness challenge and a healthy food choices challenge as well as our typical reading challenge. Our partners, Fit-N-Wise, Texas A&amp;M Agrilife Extension, Star Council, and Wise Community Health Improvement Initiative, will join us to get the word out and support the children and teens who may participate in the program. In addition, we will purchase a Healthy Living collection of books including nutrition, exercise, and making healthy choices for children and teens.
12947	23100.0	Meeting community Information needs for persons with limb loss	This proposal aims to create awareness and education capacity to utilize health information by providing access, resources and knowledge to amputees, caregivers and health care professionals on how to live healthier lives after limb loss.

12950	24997.0	M-SEARCH BYOD Project (Mobile Systems Education and Resources for Consumer Health) (Bring Your Own Device)	The proposed initiative, MSEARCH BYOD, will provide trainings for patrons and staff members at three Baker-Ripley Neighbor Center senior locations. NNLM resources that will be used in the training are MedlinePlus.gov, The National Institute on Aging, and NIHâ€™s Go4Life websites. Participants will be asked to bring their personal smartphone or mobile tablet devices if available to the trainings. Participants who cannot bring a mobile device to the training will be provided a mobile tablet device for use during each class. Participants will acquire basic mobile device user skills and learn to utilize the available tools on selected NNLM websites. Center staff will participate in all trainings and provide support to the seniors after the project is concluded. Partners include Baker - Ripley Neighbor Centers and Cizik School of Nursing at UT Health.
12953	14749.0	University of Texas at Arlington Central Library Central Library Emergency and Disaster Procedures	The purpose of this project is to ensure the preparedness of UTA librariesâ€™ staff and faculty to respond to internal and external threats that may impact our ability to provide customary services. Currently, the UTA campus has a business continuity plan and emergency procedures, but the Libraries do not. To address deficiencies, our safety programming goals include training for staff and faculty to activate and respond to shelter-in-place, evacuate, lockdown, CPR, and â€œStop the Bleedâ€ during times of emergency. Designated safety captains receive training first, then library staff and faculty. Once the library personnel is trained, American Heart Associationâ€™s Friends &amp; Family CPR and â€œStop the Bleedâ€ training will be delivered to the UTA community at large through interdisciplinary partnerships between the UTA Central Library, UTAâ€™s College of Nursing and Health Innovation, Parkland Health &amp; Hospital Systemâ€™s Trauma Outreach Education Center, UTA Police, Arlington Police Department, Arlington Fire Department, and other community partners. While we work toward these goals, we are also assessing our capacity to mitigate damages and improve our resilience to recover from an adverse event. The UTA Libraries will utilize NNLM resources such as the Disaster Information Management Research Center (DIMRC), Disaster Lit, PubMed, and Medline for community outreach efforts. We will centralize crucial information provided by NNLM that will be used during all phases of a disaster or emergency. Finally, our outreach efforts will incorporate strategies from Ready.gov and FEMA to help individuals within our community prepare themselves for emergencies and disasters. Our community partners for that phase of the project are our Kinesiology and Public Health School.

12963	1250.0	Elevating Personal Health â€“ Reaching New Peaks at Cook Childrenâ€™s through Information Prescriptions	The Cook Childrenâ€™s Family Library and the Occupational Health Clinic will collaborate to increase staff awareness and use of the library with the implementation of â€œInformation Prescriptions.â€ These â€œPrescriptions,â€ issued by providers in the Occupational Health Clinic, will identify personal health concern(s) at health appointments, and direct staff to the Family Library where they can request confidential health information. The library staff will provide information packets electronically, or in hardcopy if needed, to â€œfillâ€ the Prescription. Through this service, Prescriptions will promote the use of online resources provided by the National Library of Medicine.
12966	5000.0	Frontline Health Literacy	As health care providers, we know that health literacy is a shared responsibility between us, the patient and the patientâ€™s family. Yet, we struggle to address the issue in a way that empowers our young patients and their caregivers, particularly minorities and the underserved. We want to change that by providing specific, high-risk families with a resource that will empower them to provide the best care to their children. Cook Childrenâ€™s Medical Center currently has several initiatives that focus on identifying and assisting underserved families who are known to be repeat users of the Emergency Department. Many of these families lack a medical home. They often cannot distinguish what constitutes a true emergency. In addition, many of these caregivers lack a basic understanding of English. This project allows the Cook Childrenâ€™s Family Library to collaborate with several existing programs to provide families with an easy-to-read resource that empowers caregivers to make the best choices in relation to their familiesâ€™ health. Caregivers will be referred to Social Workers, Nurses, or Health Navigators who will provide a copy of the Institute for Healthcare Advancement book  â€œWhat to Do When Your Child Is Sick.â€ They will also receive hands-on coaching on how to use the book, community resources, and more as needed.

12972	7325.0	MINDfest: Mental Health Festival	MINDfest was designed to create a comfortable and engaging environment for community members, as well as mental health professionals, to connect and share information regarding mental wellness. The festival includes vendors from a broad spectrum of health and wellness organizations who host booths for guests to learn about local resources and opportunities. Each vendor is asked to provide an activity or service in addition to informational brochures or pamphlets in order to better engage guests and help destigmatize the seeking of mental health information. The event also features invited speakers to present on trending topics related to mental health and wellness to better educate guests on relevant healthcare issues. Lastly, an interactive area with live music and hands-on activities for all ages promotes a fun, family-friendly atmosphere. Last year these activities included recreational therapy for kids, bounce-houses, sensory beads, brain slime, and educational games about the brain. The primary purpose of the project is to increase awareness and education for mental health and wellness, as well as to promote better integration between mental health professionals and the community.
12975	10000.0	Salud y Bienestar: Entrenamiento Para Promotores/ Health and Wellness: Training for Promoters (Community Health Workers)	This project aims to increase the knowledge of suicide prevention and HIV/AIDs and raise awareness and use of National Library of Medicine resources among Community Health Workers (CHWs), students enrolled in Dona Ana Community College&#039;s CHW certificate program, and community members who will ultimately benefit.  Project partner personnel from Burrell College of Osteopathic Medicine (BCOM), Southern Area Health Education Center at Center for Health Innovation (SoAHEC at CHI), and Dona Ana Community College (DACC), propose to teach a total of eight, six-hour sessions at four rural and/or underserved border area locations on two public health topics of significant concern in New Mexico.  One of the sessions will be on the topic of Suicide Prevention led by a certified Question, Persuade, Refer (QPR) trainer, and one will be on the topic of HIV/AIDs. All sessions will include two BCOM medical librarians who will lead training on NLM resources specific to the two topics and beyond. Training materials will be translated into Spanish as appropriate and an on-site translator will be available at each session. The librarians will utilize NLM training and promotional materials as appropriate.  Each participant will be encouraged to share information on NLM resources post-training with community members.  Participants completing one or more training sessions, who possess CHW Certification by the New Mexico Department of Health (NM DOH), will be eligible to receive CEUs needed for on-going certification.  Project partners will follow-up with participants and continuously evaluate activities throughout the project to help ensure effectiveness
12978	5000.0	The HOPE Directory: Phase 2 Sustainability	The purpose of this web-based directory is to centralize access to reliable and authoritative local information, raise awareness of the role of resource libraries, and generate collaboration between organizations. By extending funding into a second year, Lewis Library will expand its growing number of resource entries, create a sustainable workflow for local organizations to input their own information, and generate educational materials to extend the reach of the directory. With this new workflow in place, the reach of the HOPE directory will continue to expand beyond Tarrant County and contribute to the reputation of the Lewis Library as a North Texas hub for connecting communities and collaborators to quality health information.
12984	10000.0	Building Health Literacy Capacity: A New Mexico Journey	Through this project, HSLIC will focus on developing meaningful and long-term connections with educational organizations and campus partners that aim to address shortages in NMâ€™s healthcare workforce. By means of providing an array of health information resources, exciting demonstrations, training and classes designed to strengthen the health sciences knowledge-base of educators to middle and high school students, we intend to break the cycle of low achievement scores via introducing participants to more health sciences instruction opportunities. HSLIC is eager to apply for the Express Outreach Award in order to cultivate awareness, foster discoverability and share our enthusiasm about the future success of students pursuing health care careers.
12987	40000.0	Empowering Band, Choir, and Orchestra Teachers with Effective Health Education Strategies	According to Nietzsche, â€œWithout music, life would be a mistake.â€ While music is a treasured experience in the education of our youth, learning and performing music presents potential health risks. For example, the World Health Organization currently estimates that 1.1 billion young people are at risk for hearing loss due to unsafe music listening practices. In response, the Texas Education Agency recently updated requirements for public school music education. As of 2015, all middle and high school band, choir, and orchestra teachers are obligated to educate their students about hearing health, musculoskeletal health, vocal health, hygiene, and hydration. Because this area of concern is new to music education, there are no known consensus-based approaches to help teachers meet this challenge. The goal of this project is to establish an annual continuing education workshop and web-based resources designed to help music educators respond to these new Texas Education Agency mandates for incorporating health education into ensemble-based instructional activities.
13005	19000.0	Enhancing Research Data Management and Discoverability via a Data Catalog Collaboration	The Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell library, in collaboration with the medical school and Northwell Health research branch, the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, will implement a local instance of the open source data catalog created by the NYU Health Sciences Library. The pilot project will meet the immediate need for the research enterprise of a frontend interface for discoverability of the data located in the Feinstein Institute public data repository. Metadata created by the librarians will describe and catalog the data, list contact information for the researchers, and link to associated publications and grant awards. The data catalog will complement the existing scholarly publications repository created by the library staff. Librarians will reach out to faculty and trainees to ascertain their needs for finding and citing their data sets, discuss adherence to publisher mandates, promote the benefits of data catalog participation, and collaborate with participants to develop optimal metadata. The project will demonstrate a successful partnership between the library and the Feinstein&#039;s Center for Research Informatics and Innovation. The library will join the Data Catalog Collaboration Project and contribute to the growing experience of academic health sciences libraries in data management initiatives.
13008	4993.0	Core Clinical Journals - Living Up to the Name	"Clinicians directly searching PubMed can apply the Core Clinical Journal (CCJ) filter to restrict retrieval. The existing CCJ list hasnâ€™t been updated since 1979, thus reducing access to the most clinically relevant biomedical and health information. Although PubMed comprises over 28 million citations, the filter to find those for patient care is currently suboptimal. 

This project would convene the Medical Library Association committee that was formed at the request of NLM to update the CCJ subset.  This working meeting would enable uninterrupted time to revise this vital list, thus increasing access to clinical information for PubMed users. Assembling the group would expedite the process while facilitating uniform journal selection.

NLMâ€™s new Strategic Plan recommends, â€œPillar 2: Engage a wide range of audiences to ensure the right information gets delivered to them at the right timeâ€ (1). CCJ exemplifies the â€œtailored approach for information dissemination,â€ but needs re-conceptualized to be more reflective of clinical subjects. 

Revising the CCJ filter would especially benefit health professionals without access to mediated searching, thus ensuring the right information is delivered at the right time to the right user. Itâ€™s timely since the impending PubMed redesign may coincide with the introduction of the redesigned CCJ filter.

13015	17438.0	Connect to your Health Wellness Fair	As one of the largest consumers of healthcare, senior adults are often left behind as new technologies are introduced to support patient engagement. The goal of â€œThe Connect to your Healthâ€ wellness fair project was to provide an interactive educational experience to connect the Seniors living in the Town of Southampton to online health-related resources. A collaborative effort between Stony Brook University, Stony Brook Southampton Hospital, and the Town of Southampton Senior Centers helped drive this project forward.  This team developed and implemented an innovative approach to encourage seniors to become familiar with technology and use it to access health education resources. Through the health fair, approximately 45 Seniors were provided with hands-on learning opportunities to learn the basic functions of iPad technology and how to use them to access reliable health information resources such as Medline Plus. Subsequently, 15 iPads were donated to the senior centers to replace existing outdated technology at the senior center. Additional interactive sessions were also provided bimonthly to increase proficiency and self-efficacy in using iPads and gaining access to health information resources.  The overall aim of this event was to create awareness of the available online resources to assist seniors with engaging in their health maintenance and to increase health literacy.   
13049	13642.0	Encountering Wellness in the Community 5.0	Reach Up, Inc. will host its 5th annual health fair in partnership with the Carnegie Free Library of Swissvale on June 22, 2019. Organizations from the local community who provide health information and services will be invited to participate as the goal of the health fair is to involve the entire community. Attendees will have an opportunity to learn about MedlinePlus and NIH Environmental Health Sciences from the National Library of Medicine through informational sessions held during the health fair. Emphasis will be on bringing awareness to the availability of health information through technology using Smart phones, tablets and personal computers. Information on NLM resources, local agencies and health education materials from NLM and other NIH agencies will also be distributed during the health fair.

13472	19751.0	The Community Health Information Connection	"The Community Health Information Connection is designed to help adults of all ages find trusted health information, play an active role in their health care decisions, and recognize the importance of naming a reliable person as health care proxy. With a focus on African American and Latino populations and community partners, the project addresses NLM cross-cutting themes to promote access to and use of NLM resources through partnerships with community organizations and increased use among diverse communities, and supports NNLMâ€™s objective to improve â€œindividuals&#039; access to information to enable them to make informed decisions about their health.â€ 

The projectâ€™s thesis is that being informed about oneâ€™s health and engaging in health care decision making directly, or through a health care proxy, is vital to adults of all ages, not just those facing serious illnesses or end-of-life decisions. Identifying health care priorities and a proxy is as important for the 18 year old who ends up unconscious in the emergency room, as it is for the 30 year old going under anesthesia for surgery, and the 85 year old experiencing memory loss.

The project focuses on the diverse urban population of Syracuse and takes a community engagement approach to developing messaging and outreach strategies that are sensitive to cultural differences, build trust and respond to how individuals prefer to receive information. Project partners are a public housing health education program and an established community engagement organization that identifies research and program priorities that community members themselves believe to be the most important to improve their health and meet their information needs.  

Deliverables will include training and collateral materials in English and Spanish about shared decision-making, health care proxies, and how to access NNLM resources on family health history, Medline Plus and other sources, which can be tailored for use in other communities.

13636	2000.0	Exhibit 264 NLM Traveling Exhibit-Graphic Medicine: Ill Conceived and Well-Drawn	The NLM traveling exhibit Graphic Medicine: Ill Conceived and Well-Drawn! will be hosted at the East Tennessee State University Medical Library in Johnson City, TN from April 29, 2019-June 8, 2019. The exhibit consists of 6 banners on stands. From the exhibit&#039;s website: &quot;Graphic Medicine: Ill-Conceived and Well-Drawn! explores an increasingly popular, yet little-known literary field that presents personal illness narratives and health information through the medium of comics. The exhibition showcases items from the NLM&#039;s growing collection of graphic memoirs depicting people&#039;s experiences with an array of health issues, including breast cancer, deafness, mental illness, HIV/AIDS, and more.&quot; The library is also planning to have several events around the exhibit. Some examples will be a medical pictionary game night, a movie luncheon, a computer set up near exhibit to allow visitors to turn pictures of themselves into cartoons. The library is also planning on developing their own graphics medicine materials in conjunction with this exhibit. The first of which will be related to women&#039;s health and telling the patient experience.
13639	1400.0	Exhibit 276 - NLM Traveling Exhibit Surviving & Thriving and Renaissance Science, Magic in Harry Potterâ€™s World	"The FIU Library has a typical weekly gate count of 35,644 visitors (https://library.fiu.edu/about/statistics), with the display located at the entrance, all visitors will view both exhibits and gain access to handouts and other NLM materials. FIU is situated in a large metropolitan area with a diverse student body: 61% Hispanic, 15% White non-Hispanic, 13% Black, 4% Asian or Pacific Islander, and 7% other minority group (https://www.fiu.edu/about/index.html). Also, it is worth mentioning that South Florida is home to 150 ethnicities and 60 languages (https://www.fiu.edu/about/rankings-facts/index.html). 
For the HIV/AIDS exhibit, this region has one of the highest rates of HIV/AIDS in the nation with 4,949 new HIV diagnoses in 2017 according to the Florida Department of Health (http://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/aids/surveillance/index.html). With the highest infection rate in the country, coupled with college-students participating in high-risk behaviors, this display is ideal for disseminating HIV prevention strategies and mitigation of risk factors.

As a fairly new medical school and continued expansions of our programs, the Renaissance Science, Magic, and Medicine in Harry Potterâ€™s exhibit is an exciting way to show medical history, with multi-disciplinary populations, including the new push for STEM majors for undecided undergraduates and for students in the social sciences, education, humanities and the arts â€“ a great way to make non-traditional connections to the subject of medicine with other academic disciplines. In December, we will include librarian subject specialists from all disciplines, including special collections to reach out and encourage class visits and related-themed programming, i.e. renaissance medicine, harry potter and literature.

Two exhibits will be located in the Steven and Dorthea Green Library lobby. Surviving &amp; Thriving, July 22 to August 31, 2019 and Renaissance Science, Magic in Harry Potterâ€™s World, December 16 to January 25, 2020. 

The exhibits will be on display at the entrance of the Green Library building with the panels facing the main reference desk where handouts will be located. The handouts for each exhibit include NLM and local public heath initiatives in the South Florida area. For example, the Florida Department of Health has spearheaded a plan to eliminate HIV transmission and reduce HIV-related deaths. The four key components include: implementing routine HIV and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) screening in health care settings and priority testing in non-health care settings, provide rapid access to treatment and ensure retention in care, improve and promote access to antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and non-occupational post-exposure prophylaxis (nPEP), and, increase HIV awareness and community response through outreach, engagement, and messaging. (http://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/aids/index.html ). We will include handouts in English, Spanish and Creole all available from the Medline Plus HIV/AIDS information page https://medlineplus.gov/hivaids.html as well as videos on PreP from AIDSource (https://aids.nlm.nih.gov/topic/1173/hiv-prevention/2015/pep-prep) and testing (https://aids.nlm.nih.gov/topic/1173/hiv-prevention/1183/testing ). 

For Renaissance Science, Magic in Harry Potterâ€™s World, the exhibit will feature a join Harry Potter-themed display in the student-reading lounge next to the reference area. This display along with the reference desk will have Locator Plus, NLM Digital Collections, Index Cat, as well as NLM PubMed Central resource handouts to educate visitors on NLM resources to further their exploration of the exhibit. Also, with special emphasis to the higher education learning module, Things most strange and wondrous: The hidden roots of modern science and medicine developed by Dr. Mark A. Waddell from Michigan State University (https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/sciencemagicmedicine/education/highereducation.html)
University-library subject specialists and faculty will promote these exhibits to the university and community organizations. "

One external speaker (a historian of nursing) will be brought to campus to speak on the history of the nursing profession its role in society. Two events will feature panels of UF faculty and local practitioners: one focused on the nursing in wartime/military nursing, and one focused on popular depictions of nursing in media. During finals (which will take place at the same time as the exhibit), a postcard writing/coloring event will be held as a wellness activity for students that incorporates materials from the NLMâ€™s historical collections. The exhibit will rotate locations during itâ€™s time in Gainesville, and when it is relocated to the CONâ€™s physical space, an opening reception will be held celebrating the exhibit. A local exhibit is being developed on local nursing history to be displayed in the libraryâ€™s exhibit cases simultaneously with the travelling exhibit. A one-credit undergraduate honors course on mid-century perceptions of community nurses is scheduled for the same semester on the exhibit, and will incorporate exhibit events into the curriculum.
13661	1207.0	AoU Exhibit 279 Wayne County Health Fair 2020	The library would like to purchase an Infinity - iPad + Monitor Kiosk that features a monitor mount, a universal tablet holder, and two literature holders to use at the health fair to promote and train individuals to utilize the MedLinePlus as their primary health resource. The library staff will talk one on one to participants to listen to their concerns and demonstrate the many features of this health resource using the IPad and TV monitor. Staff members will also distribute NLM brochures concerning health issues depending upon availability. Individual titles are not listed here as the health fair is over a year away. MedLinePlus flyers will be given to all participants as well as information focusing on nutrition and healthy eating. This year Mississippi is #3 in the nation for the most obese state. Last year it was number one and a few years ago, our county, Wayne, was the most obese county in the United States. Adults who do not exercise or those are not physically active on a daily basis is 34.5%, and the number of adults with diabetes is 17.0%. The staff will show attendees how to do utilize MedLinePlus website focusing on how to research THEIR particular health issues. If this project is funded, with the kiosk having a &quot;kick off&quot; at the health fair, the library would like to leave this kiosk in the library for the 5,000 plus patrons who visit the library to use every day, so it will be an ongoing teaching tool. Giveaways will includes items based on the nutrition theme such as &quot;100 Foods Your Body Will Love&quot;, &quot;A Guide to Healthier Fast Food Nutrition&quot;, &quot;A Guide To Good Nutrition For People With Diabetes And Pre-Diabetes&quot;.
13670	1963.0	AoU Exhibit 284 - Area Agency on Aging, Senior Lifestyles 2019 Expo	This yearâ€™s theme is â€œWe are Local â€“ Connect, Create, Contribute.â€ This will be quite appropriate as I work closely with the University of South Alabama hospitals and elderly communities promoting and creating an awareness of the rich and freely available resources from NLM contributing to better health among our community. The exhibit will consist of two tables in a corner booth that maximizes visibility. Resources will be displayed in acrylic displays to enhance the visual presence of the materials on the tables. Two Ipads will also be used to demonstrate MedlinePlus and other databases from the National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health. In previous years, this has been very valuable so that the participants can see how easy MedlinePlus is to use and the wealth of information it provides. Demonstrations is the use of Genetics Home Reference and other NIH websites will also be provided.

13705	18975.0	RDM 324 GHRconnects Professional and Community Training	"The Greater Hampton Roads Community Indicators Dashboard (GHRconnects) brings leadership and resources together to facilitate regional, data-driven decision making in Hampton Roads. As United Way of South Hampton Roads (UWSHR) receives local data from community-based organizations and collective impact initiatives, GHRconnects provides insight into the needs of these organizations and increases access to health statistics, resources, and research. By convening healthcare professionals and community organizations around local data, GHRconnects advocates for the vulnerable in our community and for the broader incorporation of data-driven decision making in the non-profit sector.

The proposed GHRconnects expansion consists of a three-pronged approach that accelerates collaborative efforts around healthcare literacy and community health outcomes. The project provides the following services: 1) the incorporation of NNLM resources alongside local data and coalition work, uniting on-the-ground action with evidence-based healthcare resources; 2) a series of â€œSuperuserâ€ trainings requested by community health workers (CHWs) and healthcare professionals to assist them in the promotion of resources; and 3) the development and implementation of online trainings to support community members and professionals as they navigate online resources and local indicators.

GHRconnects performed a community assessment with stakeholders and collaborative partners, leading to the creation of five Priority Areas on the site: Health, Economy, Education, Natural and Built Environment, and Social Environment. The Data Advisory Board, comprised of subject-matter experts, identified priorities through the creation of a strategic plan. This project will fund expansion of informational resources and allow for the development and implementation of trainings designed to increase access and use of medical information, with goals of improving health literacy in underserved populations."
13712	14538.0	Technology 303 Mobile Computer Laboratory to Augment Rural Capabilities	"The Mobile Communications and Computer Augmentation Laboratory supports local libraries with training and enhanced communications and technology. The project improves community access to information to enable them to make informed decisions about their health preparedness and recovery planning. The equipment will augment community capabilities to provide just in time information for Health, preparedness, as well as disaster response. The laboratory augments a communityâ€™s capabilities by providing access to equipment, communications and introducing key NLM information resources for disaster response to the libraries in Virginia.

We view the libraries as serving in a unique and qualified role in preparing for and responding to disaster with just in time information. The rural communities of Virginia do not always have access to computers or wifi. This program enables a Humanity Road to partner with communities to augment their current technology routinely to assist them and help improve their personal readiness plans. Under this grant, Humanity Road will partner with the local libraries to deliver training services and provide access to the mobile laboratory on a periodic and on call basis. 

Humanity Road is an award winning top rated 501c3 nonprofit, recognized at the White House by the Department of Homeland Security for its contribution to disaster response and by the United Nations as one of the top 100 innovative humanitarian aid organizations in the world. This grant will launch the first deployable technology unit. It enables us to improve our training program and support the local communities in our region. Humanity Road provides assistance in planning and supporting disaster response exercises that involve social media, offers several training options for emergency responders on social media, and can provide training workshops."
13723	15000.0	Technology 310 MUSC Makerspace	This project will seek to develop a medical makerspace to support the education and development of faculty, students and staff. MUSC currently does not have interdisciplinary makerspace that allows students and researchers to collaboratively engage in experimentation and development of medical makerspace concepts. The proposed space would facilitate the development of prototypes of 3D printing assets. The space would also serve as an area of instruction for developing three-dimensional structures and components for medical education. The medical makerspace would be centrally located on the MUSC campus and accessible to all six colleges.
13726	4902.0	Technology 327 Peace Presbyterian Church: Reaching Out with Health Information	"Peace Presbyterian Church PCUSA has a strong commitment to the health and well-being of those in the congregation and also those in the community. Because one of its major goals as always been Compassionate Outreach, Peace Presbyterian Church has become known as a â€œmissionalâ€ church. Church members regularly volunteer locally at Turning Points â€“ Homeless &amp; Veterans Assistance, Beth El Farmworker Ministry, Inc., and with other area organizations over the years. In addition to previous Haitian mission work, in 2018 a group of youth and adults made several trips to Haiti to help build two houses. 
This year members of Peace Churchâ€™s Mission and Outreach Teams are focusing on bringing quality health information to Peace Church and the community. Beginning this effort, Peace Church is conducting its first Community Health and Wellness Fair on May 4, 2019 with over 25 local service providers and agencies providing information and conducting health screenings. To introduce accessible, accurate health information at the Health Fair, the church Library will exhibit MedlinePlus and other National Library of Medicine resources. Building on this MedlinePlus introduction, the health mission of the church will promote access to and familiarity with quality sources of online NLM health information through the work of its Mission and Outreach teams. To facilitate MedlinePlus searching, funding from an Express Technology Improvement Award will acquire a desktop computer and printer to be installed in the church library, and laptop computers, Chromebooks, and a portable projector to enable training both onsite and at locations served by the Mission and Outreach teams and other church members."
13733	900.0	Technology 315 Library Services ... Because there is so much more than Google	"The Patient/Family Resource Center &amp; Medical Library at the Baptist Health South Florida - Miami Cancer Institute (MCI) is seeking to cover the hardware costs of one minicomputer and one wireless mouse/keyboard. The items will be used with an existing, wall-mounted 60â€, television screen that can be used as a computer monitor. This equipment will improve the presentation experience for bibliographic instruction to cancer patients, their caretakers, and their health care providers. Patients and family members in the MCI cancer support groups will be invited to the library, where I will conduct live tutorials on recognizing quality websites, an overview of the government and NLM recommended websites for health information, a demonstration of health-related databases in the Miami-Dade Public Library System, and the patient education databases in the BHSF Library Services System. Demonstrating how to access quality health information will empower our cancer patients to make knowledgeable decisions about their health on every step of their difficult journey.
The equipment will also be used to show physicians, nurses, and allied health employees of MCI how to use PubMed, CINAHL, SCOPUS, ClinicalKey, and our other subscribed databases, and to find the research in the professional literature that will support their evidence-based practices. Monthly presentations will offer a 15-20 minute overview of one featured database each month. Promotional invitations will go out 2 weeks prior to each presentation for a targeted department. The databases will be featured in a rotation. Instruction on the professional literature databases will bridge the digital divide between our health professionals and the research information that they need. "
13738	5000.0	Technology 325 Use of Tablet Devices to Assist in the Practice of Evidence-based Medicine in an Urban Community Health Clinic	Staff at Dahlgren Memorial Library (DML), Georgetown University Medical Center (GUMC) will coordinate purchase of 5 Apple iPad Mini 4 devices using funding from the Express Grant. These devices will be deployed for use at the HOYA Clinic. The HOYA Clinic is a student driven free clinic located in Ward 8 in the Southeast quadrant of Washington, D.C. The clinic is managed by medical students at the Georgetown University School of Medicine and provides free health services to D.C.â€™s homeless and uninsured populations. The HOYA Clinic is a partnership between Georgetown University School of Medicine, the Community Partnership for the Prevention of Homelessness, Families Forward, and the Washington D.C. Department of Human Services Playtime Project.
13743	5000.0	Technology 341 Development of a Registration and Request System for Non-affiliated Health Care Practitioners to Acquire Full-text Articles from PubMed.	News of the discontinuation of the Loansome Doc service through NLM prompted many of our current Loansome Doc clients to inquire about our future intentions. Due to the demand, need, and obligation we began exploring possible solutions to continue this valuable service. Since this is considered library operations, we are eligible to utilize REDCap software to create a registration form and a request form. All clients will register in the new system. Once approved, we will provide them with a link to the request form, process the request, and email the article(s) to the requestor. Many of our current clients belong to the Vanderbilt Health Affiliate Network but there are several who are solo practitioners or in medical groups in the surrounding areas. We also have a few health care corporations who request articles ever so often. We are fortunate to have longstanding relationships with many of our clients and have provided phone and email training/support for PubMed. In the previous PubMed-Loansome Doc system, they were able to search and order desired full-text articles. The &#039;Order&#039; button in PubMed will be terminated in July but we are confident PubMed will remain the primary resource for our clients. In fact, we are working with REDCap programmers to allow a client to input the PMID and the request form will auto-populate. Non-Medline article requests can be completed manually.
13752	15000.0	Library Project 326 Duke Digital Health Device Library	"Mobile devices are changing the landscape of healthcare and research by empowering patients and extending the reach of clinicians. 77% of US adults own a smartphone, enabling broad access to mobile devices across diverse socioeconomic and geographic populations. However, many new devices are on the market with little or no clinical validation, or the data they provide make them inappropriate for some applications or populations. Selecting the right device can enable collection of high-quality data, but requires hands-on exploration and piloting. The wrong device can introduce errors and contribute to waste, particularly because the cost of these devices is often prohibitive. The proposed device library can serve an important role in facilitating digital health care and research at Duke.
The Digital Health Device library will create a collection of digital devices that can be used in research and pilot projects across Duke University and Health System. This Device Library will enable researchers, clinicians, students and consumers to explore the capabilities of digital health devices to inform their research project design, and/or purchasing decisions for their own needs. Providing an opportunity to test these devices reduces the barriers to entry and may spark ideas which can result in new grant funding and improved medical care.
The Duke Mobile App Gateway (MAG) is composed of faculty and staff from across the institution with expertise in mobile and digital technology use for research and clinical care. The Medical Center Library provides a centralized location open to all Duke faculty, staff, students, and patients during regular business hours. The Library provides circulation of other materials and is used for in-person research training and consultation by various groups from across the institution. The Library brings experience in managing IT devices and in evaluating mobile applications and devices with an eye towards both usability and privacy."
13759	4775.0	Library Project 288 Promoting Library Resources to Encourage Health Literacy Advancements within the Appalachian Community	"The Health Information Center (HIC) is looking to increase interdepartmental partnership within the hospital community as well as promote access to library services. This project will further NNLMâ€™s mission of improving access to health information for the Eastern Tennessee community by promoting the libraryâ€™s health information service as well as using NNLM materials to teach them how to find reliable, accurate, and authoritative health information. In addition, this project will strengthen and promote the libraryâ€™s involvement with our organization. 

For this project, the HIC reached out to different hospital departments to gauge their interest in hosting â€œpop-upsâ€ in which the library would come to the departments with books, preprinted health information, and information on library services. Among these services is a free health information service in which the HIC finds health information. The goal of this project would be to engage patients, family members, and the community at these pop-ups by informing them about the HICâ€™s services and resources and teaching them about various NNLM products in which they can do their own research using reliable, accurate, and authoritative resources. This would lead to a greater collaboration within the hospital departments since the HIC would be going out into the hospital to work with patients, family members, and the community on finding health information. In addition, the HIC hopes to extend outreach with the local Farmers Market and further develop a partnership with outside organizations. "
13794	4964.0	Library Project 293 - Center for Disability Resources Library Video Production Studio	Through the purchase of video and lighting equipment and a dedicated computer station equipped with editing software, a small video production studio will be set up allowing for the Center for Disability Resources (CDR) Library to produce high-quality videos on topics of interest for parents of children with developmental disabilities and for professionals working with those families. Although the CDR and its small team of Program Coordinators currently provide information and support to families of children with developmental delays, disabilities, and chronic illnesses in a variety of ways, most of these interactions occur on a one-on-one, in person basis. To promote and improve access to the CDR Libraryâ€™s collection and information resources, and to encourage more interdepartmental and interagency partnerships, the CDR Library will collaborate with the other Program Coordinators and local disability group content experts to create freely available videos that can be accessed simultaneously by a variety of users; further, the CDR Library will create a YouTube channel to host the videos, and also feature the videos via the libraryâ€™s InfoAble Portal, a web site designed to help parents and caregivers access quality disability and health information via MedlinePlus.gov, PubMed.gov, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the CDR Libraryâ€™s books and videos collection.

13800	2245.0	Outreach 321 Pediatric Mental Health Literacy: Improving Library Service Delivery and Integration of Resources	This project proposes to develop a mental health literacy program designed for the pediatric patients in a crisis center in Florida. This program will use four tracks of bibliotherapy texts to deliver personalized bibliotherapy services to build mental health literacy skills (Cannon, 2018). Research suggests that integrating books into therapy can reduce treatment costs, increase the effectiveness of therapy, decrease time spent in treatment and the stigma associated with it, provide access to therapeutic services for those who would not be able to afford them, and empower consumers with a sense of control over their treatment and condition (Shereff, Palmer, &amp; Cannon, 2017). Furthermore, curating a collection of resources that could positively contribute to an individualâ€™s mental health literacy (MHL) increases their knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders, which help in their recognition, management, or prevention (Jorm et al., 1997). This proposal is modeled on the DACCO Library that and this proposal for pediatric residents will offer similar services by helping them find bibliotherapy texts related to their mental health condition and related issues and by then helping the children and teenagers search for new information using the mental health reference services offered by the grant project librarians. These services, which will also be developed in collaboration with the mental health professionals at the facility, will be designed to increase access to mental health and health literacy resources and encourage a more ecological approach to their health information seeking behaviors. The grant project team anticipates that, similar to the data from the DACCO Library project, the pediatric residents will have better health outcomes through increased general literacy, health literacy skills, mental health literacy skills, and empathy as a result of the library services funded through this grant (Shereff, Palmer, &amp; Cannon, 2017; Walkup &amp; Cannon, 2017).
13803	12000.0	Outreach 297 Stories of Recovery: Finding Hope and Help	In the past several years Appalachian Regional Library (public libraries of Ashe, Watauga, &amp; Wilkes Counties, North Carolina) has emphasized health &amp; wellness topics in its programming. Last year, we implemented our 1st Good Neighbor Project, Cracked, Not Broken. This project combined â€œcommunity readâ€ activities &amp; community engagement activities with the goal of educating people about suicide prevention &amp; providing avenues of engagement for those interested in helping combat suicide &amp; mental illness. We featured Kevin Hinesâ€™ book, Cracked, Not Broken, a story of attempted suicide &amp; a life-long struggle with mental illness. Hines spoke in our three counties, &amp; we brought his film to the area. Multiple partners, primarily mental health agencies, provided free programming for us. Using NNLM funding, ARL and multiple local partners will present its 2nd Good Neighbor Project, Stories of Recovery: Finding Hope &amp; Help. We will offer programs during September-November on topics related to recovering from addiction to alcohol or drugs. Our goal is to promote the hope for recovery, &amp; advertise the many treatment &amp; recovery resources available to people suffering from addiction in our service area. We will feature Dana Bowman &amp; her memoir of being a young mother &amp; an alcoholic (Bottled) as our community â€œread.â€ She will speak in all our counties, &amp; we will buy multiple copies of her book to distribute. Bowmanâ€™s story will provide a jumping off point for the many programs we will offer both at our libraries &amp; other venues, before &amp; after her presentations. We will raise awareness of the prevalence of addiction &amp; at the same time educate folks about the many resources available â€“ &amp; how to find them -- that provide help in recovery. We plan to show the film The Anonymous People, an independent feature documentary about Americans living in long-term recovery from alcohol &amp; other drug addictions that aims to end discrimination &amp; move our society toward recovery-based solutions.

Staff and faculty from these institutions, as well as the broader Atlanta community will also benefit from information literacy training, programs and an easily accessible kiosk containing health information. The project will use multiple engagement strategies to expand studentsâ€™ knowledge about how health information literacy can enhance their ability to make informed health decisions and make better lifestyle choices. This project seeks to impart knowledge and health information seeking skills to empower African American students and others from underrepresented minority groups in making better health maintenance and lifestyle choices that can be sustained throughout their lifetimes. Consisting of three main components, the project includes: 1) training from library and health information professionals on how to use a variety of freely available health information resources from local and federally funded databases such as MedlinePlus, PubMed, the Fulton County Board of Health and Center for Disease Control &amp; Prevention (CDC) Community Health Online Resource Center; 2) an accessible Woodi Health Hub Kiosk, located prominently in the Library, for users to independently peruse health information; and 3) development and implementation of a series of programs throughout the school year specifically designed to raise health and wellness awareness among college students. Programs will be designed with the assistance of graduate and undergraduate students pursuing careers in health and the sciences. The Woodi Health Hub Kiosk information will be further supplemented by printed health education literature from local and federal health agencies.

13830	5000.0	AoU 312 Health Happens in Libraries!	The West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine (WVSOM) James R. Stookey Library, and the WVSOM Center for Rural and Community Health (CRCH), are collaborating to provide health information to the public at libraries in Greenbrier County, West Virginia. Greenbrier County is a rural county in West Virginia with 35,287 population, according to the United States Census Bureau in 2017. Greenbrier County is the second largest county in West Virginia, with 1,021 square miles. Within Greenbrier County there are six public libraries, all serve rural populations. Our proposal is to organize a Health Happens in Libraries event at all six public libraries in Greenbrier County. Each of the Health Happens in Libraries events would include sessions on how to access Medline Plus, the importance of your blood pressure and how to use the Blood Pressure Health Index Score-Health Enhancement Response (His &amp; Her) cards that were created by the staff at CRCH. Medical staff of one DO will explain the importance of healthy blood pressure, health risks of blood pressure and unhealthy blood pressure. Two WVSOM second year medical students will be available to check blood pressures for those patrons who desire. Materials such as the U.S. National Library of Medicine Drug Information brochures, MedlinePlus cards, the His &amp; Her cards, Heart Disease brochures and other material associated with heart disease will be available to all who attend.
13833	15000.0	AoU 313 Healthy Grocery Shopping for Seniors in a Food Desert	The Healthy Living and Learning Center (HLLC) at the Petersburg Public Library provides a consistent and familiar place where community members go to obtain accurate and reliable health information and connect to available local resources. The majority of Petersburg residents live more than a mile away from a grocery store where fresh produce is available. The proposed healthy grocery shopping and education project aimed at under-served Senior citizens over the age of 65 is a community/grassroots effort that fills an existing void in the city of Petersburg and adjacent areas. The Healthy Living and Learning Center proposes to utilize the Petersburg Public Library bus to take groups of seniors to a Walmart grocery store for healthy shopping and back to the Library. The seniors will be escorted by a health educator from the Healthy Living and Learning Center and when appropriate; a family nutrition specialist from the Petersburg Cooperative Extension program. The round trip to the store and back to the Library will provide an opportunity for nutrition education interventions. Once in the store and led by the health educator or the family nutrition specialist, the group will go aisle through aisle assessing the different productâ€™s sugar and sodium content. Price point and the perceived value of organic products will be discussed as well. We propose purchasing two desktop computers to be placed at the Healthy Living and Learning Center for participant&#039;s easy access to health information through MedLinePLus.gov, when there are no volunteers covering the Center.

13842	14988.0	AoU 323 Connecting for Health and Hunger	"According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), more than 40 million Americans live in communities where access to healthy food is limited, identified as food deserts. A food desert is defined by the USDA as a low-income census tract in which at least 33 percent or a minimum of 500 people live more than a mile from a supermarket or grocery store in urban areas, or 10 miles from a supermarket or grocery store in rural areas. In North Carolina, more than 2 million people, including 1 in 4 children, face hunger on a daily basis, due to where they live. This problem impacts residents of both urban and rural areas across the state and is compounded by disproportionately higher rates of diet-related disease and the lost commercial vitality that makes communities livable and helps local economies thrive.

While hunger is a widespread issue, North Carolina has an exceptional resource in libraries and branches of libraries in every corner of the state. In recent decades, libraries have become safety net resources, helping our most vulnerable access food, housing, medical care, and everything else they need to be healthy. The North Carolina Alliance for Health will provide high quality health information and hunger needs assessment training to librarians in USDA identified food deserts to support their ability to improve health information literacy; improve access to, awareness of, and skills to locate high quality biomedical and health information through Medline Plus; and improve access to community resources by the vulnerable populations they serve. Ultimately, this will improve North Caroliniansâ€™ access to information to enable them to make informed decisions about their health."

Working with LCS, CHEC will conduct training workshops for CHWs. The training sessions will focus on the importance of finding reliable health information online and the evaluation of online health information. For these workshops an emphasis will be placed on using MedlinePlus.gov, specifically the siteâ€™s Spanish language version, MedlinePlus.gov/spanish and HealthReach.
13848	13100.0	AoU 330 South Carolina Read Eat Grow	"In 2018 the South Carolina State Library began a statewide food literacy initiative called SC Read Eat Grow. This project was inspired by the Culinary Literacy Center of the Free Library of Philadelphia and their work with food programs of all types. As a state we struggle with high rates of heart disease and obesity, while at the same time we have a large number of children experiencing food insecurity. Although a small number of our public libraries provide programs around a community garden or minimal cooking such as microwaves and blenders, none of the public libraries in South Carolina are currently offering any programs that connected families over food, or addressed food justice, food inequity, or introduces new cultures through the common ground of cooking together. In response to these needs, the State Library made the decision to purchase a Charlie Cart. The Charlie Cart is a mobile kitchen that is being used in a variety of ways to deliver culinary literacy training, assist with nutrition awareness at our SC Plants the Seed events in public libraries, and help library staff with a hands-on approach to STEM learning. The SC State Library would like to purchase a second Charlie Cart that will be circulated among our most rural public library service areas to provide citizens with accessible information and direct observation of healthy cooking and eating practices. Utilizing this mobile kitchen, public library staff can offer programs that help library patrons learn positive behaviors that will impact their health and that of their families. We will provide training for the public library staff who will be programming with the Charlie Cart, including ServSafe training in correct food handling processes. The Medline Food for Thought nutrition courses and similar trainings will be offered to familiarize library staff and patrons with the National Library of Medicineâ€™s resources.

By meeting the viable need of providing internet access at home, the library hopes to make consumer health information more visible and accessible. This project allows patrons to have a private and convenient way to find answers to health problems in their lives and to help them make the decision to seek help. This in turn will mean that Pemiscot County residents are better able to make informed decisions about their health and the health of their loved ones, which is the ultimate goal of the libraryâ€™s health-information efforts.

By promotion and involvement in our â€œLunch and Learnâ€ series, partnering with the county health providers â€“ Pemiscot Memorial Health Systems and the Pemiscot County Health Center â€“ we hope to provide engaging health information, as well as offering full statistics and ways to improve all aspects of health to individuals in our county. We will survey the population who attend the programs and who check out the internet hotspots to see how their lives have improved as a result of our programming and we will publish these findings in our local newspaper, as well as submitting them to the MO State Library, so that other libraries can learn from our experience. 

Implementation: Five Wifi hotspots with carrying cases will be purchased by the library for a six-month period. The hotspots will be checked out to patrons for two weeks, with two-week renewals possible after interest in the hot spots is gauged. Implementation of the project will begin as soon as the grant is awarded, with Director Teresa Tidwell delivering publicity about the program to the local newspaper, radio station, and public access television channel, as well as on the libraryâ€™s website and on the libraryâ€™s social media outlets. 

Materials collected from our partners in this plan â€“the county hospital and the county health center will be organized and filed for a convenient method of supplementing the Lunch and Learn program, which will begin in late July or early August of 2019. Some topics included for this program are: Easy Ways to Bring Exercise into your Life, Portion Control for Healthy Eating, Talking with your Doctor, Heart Disease Prevention, including the â€œCheck Change Controlâ€ information from the American Heart Association, Homeopathic Relief for Menopause, Smoking Cessation, Stress and Time Management, and Good and Bad Fats, among other topics. Caruthersville Public Library will provide a healthy lunch from our local Subway restaurant, hopefully encouraging people to drop by for the health information, which will be sent home for further study and review. This will possibly be a â€œjumping offâ€ point for the patrons to use the internet hotspots for further information and education on these subjects. 

Hotspots will be promoted at the Lunch and Learn programs, as well as through the library with flyers and instruction. They will also be announced on the same publicity outlets."

The information page for the course is at https://www.cwts.nl/education/bibliometrics-and-scientometrics-for-research-evaluation/bibliometric-course-chicago-us. 

According to the course description, attendees will be able to understand and interpret a wide range of publication and citation-based statistics, how to create bibliometric visualizations, and reflect critically on the use of bibliometric and scientometric information in the evaluation of scientific research.  

The OHSU Library currently provides a limited range of bibliometric and research impact analyses services with expertise held by just a few of our librarians. We work closely with the evaluation unit of our National Institute of Health Center for Translational Science Awards (CTSA) organization, the Oregon Clinical &amp; Translational Research Institute (OCTRI). We want to grow the capacity and sophistication of its work in this area.  By attending this course, I will be able to more effectively apply my extensive computer and data science skills to the bibliometric data retrieval, analyses, and reporting services the OHSU Library wants to develop and help expand the skills of other librarians in and beyond OHSU.

The expansion of our services in this area will enable the Library to respond to our Universityâ€™s growing interest in and use of bibliometric and other indicators to understand research activities and success, enhance our community membersâ€™ use of this data in funding applications and reports, and increase our capacity to help individuals and groups of researchers to understand and communicate the impact of their scientific contributions."

15295	14075.0	All of Us Greater Fairfield 2019-2020	"As an agent of intra-community cooperation and collaboration, the C.H. Booth Library proposes to geographically expand its successful All of Us Newtown program to neighboring communities. This will include outreach and public education to communities in greater Fairfield County concerning the All of Us Research Program (AoU) and health information literacy using resources available from the NIH via the mobile kiosk funded by the 2018-2019 AoU program. The primary goal of this project is to assist in the delivery of improved health information to the Fairfield County municipalities that neighbor Newtown, focusing primarily on women, youth, and seniors and their caregivers. Funding will provide for an outreach coordinator to present programs both in Newtown and in nearby communities (e.g., Southbury, Brookfield, Bethel, Monroe, etc) and reach into urban centers (e.g., Danbury, Waterbury, Bridgeport).
The mobile kiosk will continue to be deployed at the library as a display and also used for outreach efforts by a project staffer to teach the public about health information resources and raise health literacy levels via small group sessions.
Outreach will initially target 50 outreach events and draw approximately 600 individual consumers. The projectâ€™s primary aims are to broaden access to and awareness of health information resources, with an emphasis on those resources related to AoU, resources provided by the NLM, and to increase health literacy for the general public, especially for those interested in optimal health and wellness."
15301	19000.0	Improving Health Literacy of Library Patrons  Experiencing Homelessness and Unstable Housing 2019-2020	This project will build upon a successful 5-year evolving partnership between the New Haven Free Public Library (NHFPL) and Liberty Community Services, Inc. (LCS) by integrating All of Us resources and references in case management services provided onsite at NHFPL.  The services focus on people experiencing homelessness or unstable housing.  Libraries, as default front doors to homeless services, are in a unique position to engage community members in need of information, support services and referrals related to health, housing and potential sources of income. Health is inextricably intertwined with housing and employment opportunities. Patrons heavily utilize the LCS case management services located at NHFPL, and this project adds an important dimension to the intervention toolbox and will serve 500 people over the course of one year.
15306	12030.0	Reducing Health Disparities among VIPs - Addressing Health, Aging and Vision in North Worcester County	"This project will engage the many Visually Impaired People (VIPs) and their caretakers in North
Worcester County, specifically those residing in the Fitchburg and Leominster areas. We have a
presence in the City of Worcester area, with many VIPs and caretakers and sighted guides joining us in
the several activities that weâ€™ve organized and repeated over the past five years. We now look to our
friends to the north and invite them to join us.
Estimates of the number of VIPs in north Worcester County usually exceed 1,000, with one estimate
around 3,000. Since many people who are blind or low vision donâ€™t self-identify, the true number eludes
us. However, we know that these VIPs are typically home-bound, where isolation and depression go
hand-in-hand.
We continue to bring groups together to reduce and eliminate social, physical and logistical barriers. In
the City of Worcester, VIPs have met and interacted with sighted volunteers, with cultural organizations,
with government officials and lawmakers, with medical professionals, with transportation companies
(MBTA, Uber), media companies (Audio Journal, WCCA-TV), and non-profit organizations (Lions Club
International and others). This project will expand these interactions to include the VIPs in the
Fitchburg-Leominster areas. The long-term goal is to build similar events in the Fitchburg-Leominster
areas.
We know our efforts have brought about improvement in the physical and mental health status of many
of our participants. Our walking (WalkFit) program has grown from an average of five participants per
event, to an average of 30 per event. Other events and activities have seen similar growth. Individually,
one VIP now has the self-confidence to organize a trip to the Boston Opera House to see Phantom of the
Opera. Another VIP, predominantly home-bound before meeting us, now teaches technology at the
Worcester Senior Center. With this grant, we anticipate that we will reduce the health disparities of
VIPs for our participating neighbors in North County."

about the topic until after the fact--a habit that can create unnecessary stress or confusion about
our end-of-life wishes. Inspired in part by the â€œdeath cafeâ€ recently featured on the NIHâ€™s news
blog, the Sharon Public Library is seeking to launch an honest, open series of discussions
around this important topic. The SPL will help community members to plan and communicate
around the topics of death and dying. To that end, we intend to offer a series of speakers and
roundtable sessions on issues from digital estate planning to hospice options to different cultural

We seek funding to continue these efforts, based on demonstrated and expressed community need as well as increasing evidence of the use of libraries as places for public access to and conversations about health issues.  In our community, mental health issues and climate change concerns have risen to the top as areas of interest and apprehension.  Recent events in Vermont and across the country continue to underscore the necessity for providing resilience education at the earliest ages.  Films such as â€œResilienceâ€ demonstrate the success that such programs provide in mental and physical health well beyond childhood.  As the space open and available to all, the library is a natural location for offering access to and information about nurturing resilience in children.
Similarly, local and national effects of changing weather patterns and climates continue to affect our lives in evermore-significant ways.  The dependability of food sources not only influences our physical and mental well-being but also affects the choices we make when buying groceries and growing vegetables.  As the source of reliable and relevant information, the library can provide up-to-date and practical details about how climate change upsets the balance of our lives, particularly with regard to food security.

15795	63669.0	Multi-year Consortial Award: Knowledge is Health: Interprofessional Partnerships to Promote Health Literacy	The central objective of this project is the improvement of health literacy in underserved patient populations in Oregon through (a) the education of health professions students, providers, and interprofessional faculty and (b) the integration of appropriate information resources and communication practices into patient care. The underlying assumptions of this objective are that positive patient health outcomes will result from improved health literacyâ€”which will result from improved provider competencies. While this project will not directly measure patient outcomes or health literacy attainment, it will develop and assess strategies for integrating health literacy competencies into didactic education and clinical practice. While some strategies will be specific to individual professions, health literacy will be promoted as particularly relevant within the context of interprofessional care teams as a set of shared competencies/practices that can leverage the interprofessional model to improve patient understanding of their health and healthcare.
15829	12000.0	Health Sciences Library Partnership Award: OHSU Photo Diversity Repository Project	The OHSU Photo Diversity Repository Project arises from an identified need for teachers of health professions students to help their students visualize pathophysiological conditions in diverse populations. The proposed project will build on OHSU Libraryâ€™s existing Digital Asset Management System (DAM), a central and secure repository for images created by staff and faculty, to create a separate collection that will contain diverse digital images for educational use. To accomplish that goal, the proposed project will develop and implement standards and procedures for waiver/permission, security of protected health information (PHI), and a controlled vocabulary to describe and access diverse images. Implementation of the educational use collection of the DAM will include computer programming to enable its function and acquisition of some initial photographs that reflect diversity (skin color, age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender identity and expression, and visible disability) while focusing on visible pathophysiological conditions. The proposed project will develop robust procedures and build and launch the educational use collection of the DAM, which will be continued and expanded after the end of grant period. This digital image collection will begin to provide teachers of health professions students access to the photographs they need so that their students can learn to recognize various pathophysiological conditions in skin of various colors, increase their awareness of issues related to health and diversity, and prepare them for more effective clinical work with their future patients.

The idea of a simple action leading to profound change inspired the Mohawk Valley, Upper Hudson and Southern Adirondack Library systems to collaborate on a regional pilot project, Library   Moon Walk. This project will develop community awareness of NNLM resources and build relationships between public libraries and health organizations while encouraging people in the Mohawk Valley, Southern Adirondacks, and Capital Region of New York State to create healthy habits.    The project has two parts and a challenge. The first targets library professionals and representatives from community health organizations by providing training sessions encouraging the use of online NNLM consumer health resources. The second part focuses on 25 public libraries developing consumer health programs for the public. The challenge, will build excitement by having the public log the amount of exercise they get on a webpage, with the goal of accumulating enough steps to cover the distance it would take to walk to the moon. This goal ties into the 2019 Collaborative Summer Library Program theme, A Universe of Stories, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the first man on the moon.

Opioid-related mortality in the United States has increased rapidly over the past decade, especially in Philadelphia, which has the highest overdose mortality rate among major U.S. cities. To mitigate the burden placed on public librarians who experience opioid overdoses on site, we are partnering with the Free Library of Philadelphia (FLP) and the Philadelphia Department of Public Health (PDPH) to deliver opioid awareness and harm reduction trainings to public librarians and patrons in Philadelphia. Building upon the success of our four-module Community Health Specialist training program, this project seeks to develop and test a fifth module on Opioid Harm Reduction. This module, which will be delivered in person at the South Philadelphia Library Branch (Goal 1) and online (Goal 2), will include active learning opportunities and an introduction to NLM resources to increase trainees&#039; knowledge and self-efficacy regarding these important issues.

16023	18915.0	All of Us Health Literacy Outreach Award: Access Health at East Adams	"The East Adams Library District is a small, rural library in Eastern Washington State that serves multiple small communities in the eastern part of Adams County. Over the years, our communities have steadily lost access to social and health services while seeing a severe decline in annual income per capita all while experiencing an increase in mental and physical health related issues. Our library has decided to confront this issue head on with the creation of â€œAccess Health at East Adamsâ€. Access Health at East Adams will address our patronâ€™s needs in three ways. The first component is our adult centric, monthly health literacy program which will run for the period of one year. The program follows NNLMâ€™s selected National Health Observances focusing on one topic per month and provides programming such as visiting speakers and other activities that cater to that specific topic as well as to our community. The second component is a dedicated health and social services computer and workstation within the library which would provide patrons the ability to access various health and social services including but not limited to: MedlinePlus, Genetics Home Reference, health insurance and/or Medicare/Medicaid, telemedicine, and other needs-based programs. The last component of Access Health at East Adams is increasing the level of service our library staff will be able to offer patrons looking for information on various health topics. This will be accomplished by increasing our medical and health catalog, training staff on NNLM/NLM/NIH health information websites and providing key staff the opportunity to attend conferences that will bolster the Access Health at East Adams health literacy program and the libraryâ€™s ability to meet the publicâ€™s needs. Access Health at East Adams allows our library to join the NNLM in their mission to â€œimprove the publicâ€™s access to information to enable them to make informed decisions about their healthâ€.

16061	17574.0	Wash and Learn: Health Literacy  in Laundromats	"Health literacy is a critical pathway to better health outcomes. Yet for countless low-income families, health resources like those on MedlinePlus are simply out of reach. Some are unaware of its existence while others simply lack the digital skills to find what they&#039;re looking for. By meeting people where they are-while waiting at the laundromat-Libraries Without Borders (LWB) strives to empower low-income families with the information they seek in a manner that conforms to their everyday schedule.  In partnership with the Allegheny County Library Association (ACLA), we will facilitate health literacy programs inside Sudsy&#039;s laundromat in South Park Township, PA. Once the site is set-up, we will convene community-based organizations and health providers to offer services at the laundromat according to the needs identified by librarians. We will write and publish a case study drawn from the experience of ACLA in order to gather best practices that build upon our past health literacy work in laundromats, including a recent NNLM-supported program in Minnesota. These findings will enable us to better train libraries and librarians how to integrate health literacy into the Wash and Learn Initiative, a national program led by LWB to provide educational resources in laundromats.

Staffed by an Education Director, Education Specialist and LPN Educator, the NE CHA is responsible for coordinating the education and assistance to a nineteen county service area in Northeastern Oklahoma.

The OHAI staff will provide community education based classes in the areas most affected by the recent flooding of the Arkansas River. These sessions for community members will be based on two existing classes: Healthy Brain, Healthy Mind and Gateway Diabetes Self-Management Educations. OHAI will also provide sessions targeting disaster preparedness/response and emergency staff based on the Aging Simulation Sensitivity Training (ASiST) program developed at the University of Oklahomaâ€™s Department of Geriatric Medicine. Additional detail about all three of these existing classes is provided below.

These classes will be taught by OHAI staff or volunteer instructors who are all trained and experienced educators. Our educators are well connected in the local communities they teach in and have strong networks with aging related and community organizations. OHAI educators will work with faith based organizations, Area Agencies on Aging, senior nutrition sites, banks, pharmacies, hospitals, clinics, counseling, home health, hospice, libraries, county and municipal governments to locate individuals in need of community programming and/or disaster and emergency staff who wish to be trained.

17467	102708.5	Employing Community Wellness Liaisons to Create Public Libraries That are Inclusive for Five Diverse Utah Communities	"This project has been designed by the Community Faces of Utah (CFU), a collaborative group established in 2009. CFU members include leaders of the Best of Africa (serving African immigrants/refugees), Calvary Baptist Church (serving primarily African Americans), the Hispanic Health Care Task Force (serving Hispanics/Latinos), the National Tongan American Society (serving Tongans and other Pacific Islanders/Native Hawaiians), and the Urban Indian Center of Salt Lake (serving American Indians/Alaskan Natives), as well as leadership and staff of the Community Collaboration and Engagement Team (CCET) of the Utah Center for Clinical and Translational Science, the University of Utah Department of Family and Preventive Medicine, and the Utah Department of Health. CFU has 10 years of experience in collaborating with researchers and each other in carrying out health education and research projects. A particular strength of the collaborative is our culture of learning with and from each other and those with whom we collaborate. In this way, we efficiently learn ways in which programs can be implemented similarly across the five communities and ways in which programs need to be tailored for each community. Thus, the CFU collaborative provides a unique opportunity to synergistically and simultaneously learn with five diverse communities.

Evidence of need for the project
The need for the proposed project was the outcome of a prior CFU project which was funded by the NNLM MidContinental Region and titled â€œBuilding Usage of Public Libraries as a Source of Health Information in Five Diverse Utah Communities.â€ For that project, we held Community Engagement Studios (CE Studios; Joosten, et al, 2018) with community â€œexpertsâ€ from each CFU community; these individuals are experts by virtue of their lived experience and participated in the CE Studios as consultants. We also held a CE Studio consultation with librarians from Salt Lake City and Salt Lake County libraries in the areas where CFU community members live. Finally, we held a stakeholder workshop with CFU and the librarians to discuss the findings from the CE Studios and to draft a plan for increasing usage of public libraries and library programs as sources for health information by members of the CFU communities. The primary component of this plan is the proposed 6-month pilot program for hiring members of the five CFU communities (1/community) to serve as Community Wellness Liaisons at city and county libraries.

18133	19999.0	 Chronic Disease Management 10: Maximizing Your Health in the Digital Age 	"The Critical Path Learning Center (CPLC) at Philadelphia FIGHT Community Health Centers will design a series of 10 health and wellness workshops called â€œChronic Disease Management 10 (CDM10): Maximizing Your Health in the Digital Ageâ€ that will leverage NLM online resources and mobile applications to support those who are living with chronic diseases.  The workshops support learners in managing their health beyond the clinicianâ€™s office and integrating NLM and NNLM resources into their health management strategies, enabling learners to increase their knowledge and skills around chronic illnesses common in our patient population. Each workshop will include the use of a phone application or online health management tool to help participants increase their digital health literacy skills. CDM10 will reach 100 participants by:  

â€¢ Developing an engaging curriculum covering 10 chronic disease topics that are the most common illnesses among Philadelphia FIGHTâ€™s health center population such as diabetes, hypertension, HIV, hepatitis C, and other chronic conditions impacting our communities.  
â€¢ Incorporating digital literacy instruction through the curation of reliable online health information such as Medline Plus, recommended apps, and/or websites to support healthy living, across numerous devices. 
â€¢ Providing one-on-one sessions with Learning Center staff to monitor and address challenges and barriers to using online health management tools and health management apps.  "
18395	18906.0	All of Us Health Literacy Outreach Award: Healthy Pathways: programs, resources, and education for Multnomah Countyâ€™s Vietnamese, Cantonese, and Mandarin communities	"Over twelve months, Multnomah County Library (MCL) will plan, pilot, and evaluate six healthy lifestyle workshop series for Asian families in Multnomah County with a specific focus on Vietnamese, Mandarin, and Cantonese speaking populations. Our project will support these communities&#039; health literacy needs by offering health lifestyle programs on nutrition and healthy cooking, fitness, which may include tai chi, qi gong, zumba, yoga, martial arts, and meditation and culturally relevant stress relief programs like karaoke and ping pong in their own language. Each program will include a short presentation on MedlinePlus showing participants how to access health and healthy lifestyle information in different languages by library staff.

This project will focus on Vietnamese, Mandarin, and Cantonese speaking communities due to language and culture barriers which prevent healthcare information access and which have effects on long term health outcomes for these communities. We choose to focus on healthy lifestyle education because it is one of the core tenants of precision medicine, which is a focus of the NNLM All of Us Community Engagement Network and is a needed topic in these particular communities, as evidenced by health outcomes including diabetes, social isolation and low birth weights. The goal of this project is to increase participantsâ€™ trust and confidence in the public library as a health information resource by offering educational opportunities and access to reliable health activities and databases.

Multnomah County Libraryâ€™s project staff will work with the National Network of Libraries of Medicineâ€™s Pacific Northwest Region and our libraryâ€™s learning and organization development team to provide training to library staff that serve Vietnamese and Chinese
communities on MedlinePlus. After being trained, library staff will be able to help library patrons be aware, find, and translate health information to to better their health literacy. Library staff will have promotional materials for the All of Us Research Program available at their library locations and during the programs. Staff will be available to interpret information that is not available in Vietnamese, Cantonese, and Mandarin and provide more information about the program. Providing fun community-based activities will allow us to have conversations about health resources, improving the public&#039;s access to information to enable them to make informed decisions about their health. Talkback boards and follow up surveys will be used to evaluate the success of our goals."
18455	49883.0	Ixodes Outreach Project: A Northern MN Community Education and Research Program  	Lyme Disease (LD) is an emerging epidemic in the Upper Midwest. Early identification of LD symptoms is paramount to effective medical treatment; knowledge of symptoms, how LD spreads, and getting immediate medical treatment is the best prevention. This NLM proposal introduces the Ixodes Outreach Project (IOP). IOPâ€™s goal is to promote awareness of health concerns associated with LD and tick-borne diseases in northeast Minnesotaâ€™s isolated Arrowhead region. This will be accomplished through educational activities, a citizen-science program, and an undergraduate research experience. Education outreach will target Native American and rural populations and will include presentations at schools and environmental centers, development of LD brochures, information on MedlinePlus and the CDC tick-borne disease online reference. Workshops will be held to provide in-depth LD information; participants will be given â€œTick Kitsâ€ and invited to be part of IOPâ€™s citizen-research program. Tick kits will contain a Tick Removal Key with the University of Minnesota Medical School (UMMS) and NLM logos, tick and LD information cards, collection tubes, and mailing envelopes for tick submission to the Principal Investigator (PI). Citizen-science opportunities will involve community members collecting ticks for analysis of Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacteria causing LD. Using tick kits from workshops, participants will provide ticks gathered in daily outdoor activities thereby assisting in identifying areas where the tick, Ixodes scapularis, shown to carry Borrelia, comes in contact with humans. A web-based â€œTick Story Mapâ€ will further promote LD awareness. This online resource will combine images, video, a series of maps, including a tick-borne disease risk map, and a database for LD and tick-borne disease research. Citizen-scientists may review and contribute to the database using an online application to submit information such as weather conditions, date, time of day, vegetation and geographic terrain, and the types of activity when Ixodes tick contact occurred. College students will learn about Ixodes and LD as they gain valuable experience participating in field collections (tick drags), science enrichment activities to systematically survey for Borrelia-infected Ixodes, performing lab-based PCR analysis and presenting research poster presentations of their work.
18480	10000.0	Health Matters: Educating Library Staff to Respond to Health Literacy Needs in their Communities	This project will support public librariesâ€™ efforts to address their communitiesâ€™ health information needs by presenting a pilot Health Literacy course within Northern Kentucky Universityâ€™s (NKU) Library Informatics (LI) BS program (https://www.nku.edu/academics/informatics/programs/undergraduate/libraryscience.html.) Project funding will be used for tuition, fees, and textbook allowance for seven students who are currently working in a public library located in a Kentucky Medically Underserved Areas (MUA). (https://data.hrsa.gov/tools/shortage-area/mua-find.  (Fifty-four Kentucky areas have been reviewed and designated in the last five years.)  The LI program is online and accessible to staff members serving communities which are not near a University with a library science program. The course content will aid library staff in building health literacy among their users as defined in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, Title V, â€œthe degree to which an individual has the capacity to obtain, communicate, process, and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions.â€ Specifically, course learning objectives will be focused upon building knowledge of public health resources (NLM resources in particular as due to their ready accessibility), development of effective skills for information searching in this field, and awareness of best practices for library programming in consumer health. Utilizing their learning achievements in these areas, students will create a programming action plan to address a specific public health concern. Students will gain awareness of project funding options as the action plan project as it will include the creation of a project proposal for GMR funding. Scholarships will be awarded based upon 1) a description of a specific public health concern which their public library could respond to, 2) confirmation that the applicant student is employed in a public library located in a  MUA , and 3) a letter supporting the application from the Library Director (or Library Board member if the applicant is the Director.) The action plan each of these seven students develops during the course will address the public health concern they identified in their application.  All student projects in this course will be made available through NKUâ€™s institutional repository and publicized through multiple communication channels.

18874	38565.0	Connecting and Improving Digital Literacy & Health Literacy Outcomes in Public Housing	"The Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh (HACP) is requesting grant funding to expand its existing digital literacy program, which is designed to bridge the digital divide among low-income public housing communities. HACP is proposing to incorporate health literacy programming by incorporating MedlinePlus and other online health tools into the curriculum of its existing digital literacy program. Improved digital literacy and health literacy in HACP communities will provide hundreds of low-income senior citizens, youth and adults with improved knowledge of a variety of health and wellness topics, improved awareness of diseases and illness and improved access to treatment and prevention measures. 

HACP will use grant funds to support an additional full-time digital literacy professional for an eight-month period (Oct. 2019 â€“ April 2020) and to purchase additional hardware and software that will be vital to this effort. Additionally, HACP will partner with Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh (CLP) to provide training to the HACP personnel who will conduct digital literacy programming and incorporate health literacy into our curriculum.  

CLP will provide HACP with training to enhance their knowledge of library programs and resources and how to incorporate these resources into regular HACP programming. Once training is complete, HACPâ€™s digital literacy team will have the knowledge and expertise needed to incorporate health related resources into their curriculum. HACP staff will then work toward a goal of providing residents with access to a wealth of health and wellness information available online. 
Staff will be trained to be fully proficient with the MedlinePlus website and will be educated on a variety of additional digital health-related resources that are readily available through the CLPâ€™s online system. Moving forward, we will use our digital literacy programming as a vehicle to promote and improve health literacy among HACPâ€™s resident population.

19788	19465.0	BGH College Ambassador Program: Mental Health Awareness Campaign	"How can public libraries help educate the community about mental health awareness and prevention affecting women of color? This is the driving question Black Girl Health Foundation, Inc. seeks to answer through our College Health Ambassador Program. Studies from the National Institute of Health (NIH) demonstrate the success of community ambassadorial projects. Ambassadors are members of the community who engage within the community to encourage health awareness and internal health engagement and outreach program that underpins the goals of Black Girl Health. Specifically, this project within the pre-existing ambassador program will use MedlinePlus, and information about NIHâ€™s All of Us Research Program to educate the community about mental health awareness and prevention. BGH Health Ambassadors will work in at least two (2) public libraries in the Dauphin County Library System in the Greater Harrisburg Area of Pennsylvania to promote mental health awareness and prevention using MedlinePlus. 

Our overarching goal of this outreach project is to educate African American women, targeting ages 18-49. The project will include the following objectives: 
1) Development and execution of mental health campaign that will serve as a promotion tool to engage the target audience about the upcoming workshops. 
2) Complete 6 in-person workshops focused on mental health awareness at two (2) public libraries in the Harrisburg, PA area. These workshops will be lead magnets to also share information from NIHâ€™s All of Us Research Program and promote MedlinePlus resources. 
3) Collect at least 75 completed MedlinePlus based knowledge assessments from the target audience, which will educate the community on mental health using information from MedlinePlus. This project benefits public health by encouraging African-American women, a high-risk population, to take control of their mental health with increased knowledge from a reliable resource (MedlinePlus)."
19795	19500.0	Promoting Cervical Pap Tests for LGBT Community Members in Pennsylvania through Public Library Outreach	Gynecologic cancers do not discriminate based on sexual orientation or gender identity, but the social conditions in which LGBT people experience healthcare in the United States do: LGBT community members who were assigned female at birth are significantly less likely to be up to date with cervical Pap tests, as compared to the national average (2018 Pennsylvania LGBT Health Needs Assessment). While there are a variety of unique challenges for LGBT people that may cause this health disparity, Bradbury-Sullivan LGBT Community Center identifies a few major obstacles: 57% of LGBT people report fear of a negative reaction from their health care providers regarding their identity, and 34% find their clinicians slightly or not at all knowledgeable about crucial LGBT-specific health issues. This lack of inclusivity and knowledge is amplified among individuals assigned female at birth who do not engage in sex with men, as they are often misinformed, even by their own clinicians, about their necessity for cervical Pap tests. Through a previous grant from a different funding source, Bradbury-Sullivan LGBT Community Center developed a leading-edge cervical Pap test promotion campaign; however, that funding for our ongoing outreach has been exhausted.  Our campaign, â€œIf Youâ€™ve Got It, Pap It!â€ is a transgender-inclusive campaign to promote cervical Pap tests to community members who need them. Through this project with NNLM MAR, Bradbury-Sullivan LGBT Community Center will be able to reengage our community on this important issue through direct outreach and education at public libraries in eastern Pennsylvania.

Subjects covered include:
â€¢	Techniques to deal with problems such as frustration, fatigue, pain and isolation
â€¢	Appropriate exercise for maintaining and improving strength, flexibility, and endurance
â€¢	Appropriate use of medications
â€¢	Communicating effectively with family, friends, and health professionals
â€¢	Nutrition
â€¢	Decision making
â€¢	How to evaluate new treatments
Workshops will meet once a week for 2 Â½ hours for 6 weeks in two public libraries. The small-groups are facilitated by a pair of trained leaders - one or both of whom are a non-health professional who lives with a chronic disease.

19801	19500.0	End of Life Community Education Program	"No dying person should have to endure more suffering than he or she is willing to bear.  However, many people die protracted deaths often in ways inconsistent with their wishes. Too many people also receive levels of care and treatment at the end of their lives that they do not want or would not want if they were fully informed of their treatment options. Patients often have bad deaths because they were not provided with palliative care or informed about hospice.

Additionally, demographic differences play a role in end of life care and there are pronounced health disparities.  Compared to their white counterparts, African Americans and Latinos are less likely to receive adequate pain management, hospice care, and information about end of life options. They are also less likely to have advance directives or have designated healthcare agents.  The need for educational services is crucial.  There is a tremendous lack of understanding and misconceptions around advance care planning, hospice, and palliative care.  

We plan to offer two of our most popular education programs to libraries in New York.  We will offer 20 programs (6 Spanish, 14 English) in libraries in 8 counties (Kings, Nassau, Queens, Manhattan, Bronx, Suffolk, Albany, Westchester).  Planning for a Better End of Life is a 60-minute program designed to educate seniors and caregivers about their rights and options at the end of life available in English and Spanish.  Being Mortal: Rights, Choices, and Important Conversations, is a 90-minute program to promote discussion about advance care planning, treatment options, and health care rights, which includes the screening of PBS documentary Being Mortal.  The overall goals of the programs are to educate seniors and caregivers; provide actionable information and resources that will improve quality of life at the end of life and promote respect of their healthcare wishes.

Middle Atlantic Region (MAR) to support the public health education activities of Jewish Family and Childrenâ€™s Service of Greater Philadelphiaâ€™s (JFCS) Hoarding Support Program, an innovative model of hoarding treatment and intervention. Over the course of the grant period, JFCS will use funds awarded under the Health Programming in Public Libraries Award to launch new educational partnerships, trainings, and public health information sessions targeted to the general public, those living with hoarding disorder, and caregivers who work with adults struggling with Hoarding Disorder, with the goal of increasing awareness and understanding of how to help adults impacted by hoarding disorder live safe, stable, and productive lives. JFCS will partner with two to three libraries in the Greater Philadelphia Region to offer six, two-hour informational sessions that will touch on the causes of hoarding disorder; signs and risk factors associated with hoarding disorder; the impact of this disorder on individuals, family and caregivers, and the wider community - including its impact on public safety; and resources and referrals on where and how to seek services and support. Through this public education program, JFCS seeks to reach 150 to 200 community members."
19809	16874.0	Health Information Training  to Improve Health Literacy Among Older Adults	"Northeast NORC, a program of the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia provides community based support to older adults aging in place in their own homes in Northeast Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  NORC staff work with more than 50 community partner organizations.  Approximately 500 volunteers annually, either individuals or members of those organizations provide incidental and preventative services and information to address health and safety issues among older adults. 
Objective: Make information about chronic disease management, general health conditions, and wellness issues available to older adults by offering education programs in their neighborhoods and assist with transportation to those programs if needed.  
Target Population:  Northeast NORC focuses efforts in six zip codes in Northeast Philadelphia where 65,000 older adults reside, helping them age successfully in their communities. Even though 71% of adults over age 60 in Philadelphia own their own homes, many NORC members face economic challenges and social isolation. Over 75% of NORC members receive public benefits, including SNAP and PACE/PACENET. 65% of NORC members live alone, and 90% of those living alone have incomes below 250% of the Federal Poverty Line (FPL). 22% of members report that they lost a spouse or family member during the year and 23% require transportation assistance to get to medical appointments.

19812	7903.0	QPR (Question Persuade Refer) Suicide Prevention Training	"Suicide has become an epidemic, not only in Pennsylvania but also throughout the United States.  According to the latest statistics (Center for Disease Control), 47,173 people died from suicide in the United States and over 1.2 million people attempt suicide.  Suicides occur every 11 minutes, which equals 129 people per day, and is the 10th leading cause of death in this country. In Pennsylvania, the latest statistics show that 2,030 people died from suicide, and five people per day die from suicide.  Statistics show that both the state of Pennsylvania and the United States have had a 33% increase in suicide since 1999.    
We believe that training and education can bring awareness and make a difference in the prevention of suicide. One such method is QPR Suicide Prevention Training.  QPR stands for Question, Persuade, and Refer â€“ 3 simple steps anyone can learn to help save a life from suicide.  QPRâ€™s mission is to save lives and reduce suicidal behaviors by providing innovative, practical, and proven suicide prevention training.  This educational training empowers all people, regardless of their background, to make a positive difference in the life of someone they know at home, in the workplace, or anywhere.  
A &quot;Gatekeeper&quot; is someone in the position to recognize a crisis and the warning signs that someone may be contemplating suicide. Gatekeepers include parents, friends, neighbors, teachers, ministers, doctors, nurses, police officers, fire fighters and many others who are positioned to recognize and refer someone at risk of suicide.  
QPRâ€™s Training Objectives include: discuss facts concerning Suicide and Suicide Prevention, recognize warning signs of those who may be thinking about Suicide, give information on how to ask the Question about Suicide, Persuade them to get help and Refer to the proper resource, and give resources concerning those who attempt suicide and surviving family and friends.
Our goal is to train people from all different walks of life that are found in libraries.  Because the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behavior are pervasive across age, gender, race, etc., this proposal will directly impact countless individuals, who attend libraries, as libraries are the communities in which we all live.  In short, the more people trained in QPR, the more lives that we can save.

19818	9941.0	Living with Diabetes	"Rural populations face unique challenges in meeting health and wellness goals including a lack of proximity to healthcare facilities, high chronic disease burden, and poverty.  Rural residents are also less likely than metropolitan residents to participate in clinical research trials, which can widen the disparities in treatment and interventions that meet their needs. The Rural Outreach Center seeks funding to partner with public libraries to address the following objectives to overcome obstacles and reduce disparities faced by rural populations: 1) educate people with diabetes on how to manage this chronic condition, 2) provide these individuals with information about how to seek credible, high quality health and medical information to enhance health literacy and diabetes management skills, and 3) to introduce the tenets and importance of clinical research in diverse population, while promoting awareness of NIHâ€™s All of Us program.   
In conjunction with health educators and public libraries, the Rural Outreach Center proposes to hold a 6-week educational program, called â€œLiving with Diabetesâ€ at 2 rural public library sites in Western New York. "
19867	100394.0	JUNTOS por su SALUD: Librarians and Health Professionals Empowering Latinos with Evidence-Based Health Information	"The purpose is to increase the access of Spanish-speaking Latinos in the Kansas City area to reliable health information in their language, inform them about existing resources, and develop a sense of trust between them, the medical community and librarians. The goal is to develop and produce quality, evidence-based smartphone-friendly content tailored to the linguistic, literacy and cultural needs of medically underserved Latino subgroups and disseminate it through the online platforms that these communities use to increase their awareness of important health information that can be used to improve their health or the health of their loved ones.

Latino immigration trends and variations in geographical occupation shape their access to health information and resources too. In the three counties of the Kansas City metropolitan area with larger immigrant populations, there are 150,000 Latinos and about 54,000 are immigrants. Latino immigrants in this area predominantly belong to underserved subgroups. They have lower English proficiency and levels of education and higher poverty rates. They are also less likely to have health care coverage and a medical home. Developing high quality, smartphone-friendly content tailored to the linguistic, literacy and cultural needs of medically underserved Latino subgroups and disseminating it through the online platforms that they use present health professionals and librarians with a great opportunity to provide Latinos with evidence-based resources to improve their health.

This project will further support the partnership between JUNTOS por la SALUD and the A. R. Dykes Library at the University of Kansas Medical Center and the JUNTOS Center for Advancing Latino Health. The project will work with Spanish-speaking health care professionals in the Kansas City area to offer quality health information for Spanish-speaking Latinos in a language that is easy to understand and relevant to their health needs and culture. The project team made up by Latinas with health research, library information science, and community engagement and communication background will capitalize on the trust and reputation of the JUNTOS Center and partnerships of the National Network of Libraries of Medicine Mid-Continental Region in Kansas to deliver smartphone-friendly content via Podcast and supported through JUNTOS Facebook and other social media platforms that Latinos commonly use. The long-term vision of this pilot project is to become a national source of reliable health information for Spanish-speaking Latinos
across the US.

The JUNTOS Center for Advancing Latino Health, based at the Population Health department at the University of Kansas Medical Center, seeks to generate and disseminate knowledge to eliminate health disparities in the under-served Latino communities in Kansas. They focus on building healthier communities through community-based participatory research programs that translate research findings toward the elimination of health disparities.

20192	19999.0	The H.I.L.L. (Health Information Literacy and Learning) Project	"The Brooklyn-Queens-Long Island Area Health Education Center will be implementing the H.I.L.L. (Health Information Literacy and Learning) Project as a proposal for this grant. The H.I.L.L. Project encompasses four main learning objectives that will be targeted to high school students in Brooklyn. At the end of the program students will have:

1. Increased knowledge about health information literacy by measuring their ability to access valid and reliable information, evaluate the information they find and recognize databases such as Medline plus as a quality source for healthcare information.
2. Increased understanding of healthcare disparities and social determinants of health as it relates specifically to issues related to health literacy including immigration policy and access to healthcare.
3. Increased leadership, advocacy and community engagement skills to assist their peers, families and other community members in finding reliable health information and helping them to evaluate that information.
4. Increased interest and knowledge about health careers, especially health information related careers.

This project will also guide students in understanding the importance of advocacy and the impact of policy on immigrant health. In order to accomplish these objectives BQLI AHEC will partner with the Brooklyn Public Library and New York Immigration Coalition. These objectives will be achieved by using the Project SHARE Curriculum created by the University of Maryland. All activities will be implemented by the BQLI AHEC program staff.
Students who successfully complete the program will have showed increased skills in their ability to access reliable and valid health information. Students will also have increased knowledge about health issues in their communities and understand social determinants of health. In addition, students will be motivated to take action and act as health advocates for themselves and their communities. With this project we are hoping to introduce students to broader aspects of healthcare that they may not have been aware of such as careers related to healthcare analysis and data collection."

20305	19500.0	Eat, Move & Live in Balance	Eat, Move &amp; Live in Balance is an extension of Wellness for Everybody initiative. The goal of the program is to address the need for nutritional education and fitness engagement to help decrease the health disparities in the African American community.  Specifically, among low income and single-family homes where families could most benefit from developing sustainable healthy eating habits through coaching, creating menus, supermarket tours and healthy cooking demos. In addition, consumers would be introduced to various fitness activities that are low or no cost. Physical fitness activities consumers can sustain after the program ends. BeautiFitStrong Camp for Girls along with BeautiFitStrong Fitness Studio and program staff are committed to this program. The goal of the program is to educate, engage and connect families to healthy nutrition and fitness activities that can be sustained. When healthy eating is more affordable and the food tastes good, the targeted population will be more likely to see it as a possible lifestyle change. In the same token, when exercise seems doable, is made to be fun, family oriented and affordable; consumers are more likely to engage in exercise as a lifestyle habit. Eat, Move &amp; Live in Balance will utilize COFFEE, BeautiFitStrong, LLC, NNLM resources and our library partners to complete a series of health &amp; fitness programs.

The adaptation of their typical programming for public library audiences in urban and suburban neighborhoods in Philadelphia and Delaware Counties will be largely influenced by timing. Rather than starting the workshop series with the development of a garden, they will end the programs with the development of a Spring/Summer garden.  
 
While each public library garden will be unique because of access to space, patron demographics, and culture of the members, all of the library gardens will provide opportunities for participants to build social connections, become environmental stewards, self-reflect and be better equipped to make continuous healthy choices. At the close of workshops, participants and library staff should also know the fundamentals of garden care. "

20585	5592.0	Methodist Services Purse	"The Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine (PCOM) Student-Run Clinic (SRC) prides itself on being more than a â€œpop-upâ€ clinic for the medically-underserved of Philadelphia. As osteopathic student physicians, SRC leaders identified outreach to address barriers preventing Philadelphians from seeking medical attention. Transportation to primary care is a well-documented socioeconomic barrier for Medicaid patients and rideshare services offer greater convenience and lower cost, Chaiyachati et al. (2018). In conjunction with ridesharing, patient education services using NLM resources will be offered at four touch points; monthly workshops, SRC patient encounters, follow-up wellness visits at PCOMâ€™s Family Clinic and making NLM resources available onsite at Methodist services 24/7 via the Parenting Collaborative Educator  
The SRC has three localities at emergency housing or shelter settings, in various zip codes throughout Philadelphia. The Clinicâ€™s student leaders plan to open the Methodist Services campus as a fourth healthcare location to offer clinical and educational services. Our partner, Methodist Services, is an organization in West Philadelphia that provides housing and wellness services to local children, women and families. This new partnership is scheduled to commence on December 1st, 2019. Our objective at Methodist Services is trifold; the SRC serves to provide immediate and accessible care, to educate our patients, and to empower these underserved populations to establish and maintain a relationship with the healthcare system that may otherwise be inaccessible.  
Patient education will be integrated into SRC-led clinic patient encounters, monthly health information workshops and follow-up visits at PCOM Family Medicine to ensure quality distribution of health information resources.  Additionally, the implementation of a rideshare service will mitigate the transit barrier which is a social determinant of health that our patients face. This initiative integrates nicely with NLMâ€™s 2027 Strategic Plan.  First, offering ridesharing to vulnerable populations engages more people in new ways of delivering reliable health information. Second, if the model proves worthwhile, it could possibly be replicated at PCOMâ€™s other SRC that serve Phillyâ€™s medically underserved populations.

20588	19500.0	Partners in Engaging Diverse Populations in Research	"Engagement of diverse populations in clinical research studies is crucial for ensuring that the needs of these groups are represented in scientific outcomes. Members of minority groups participate in research studies at much lower rates than white individuals (Colon-Otero, 2008). These disparities in research participation can exacerbate already existing racial/ethnic differences in health outcomes (Smedley, 2002). Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Centerâ€™s Office of Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) is dedicated to research that advances the understanding of these disparities and to developing and offering integrated community-based services and educational programs tailored to meet the needs of these populations. The mission of COE is to assure that all cancer patients and communities in Western New York can benefit from the clinical and scientific advances accomplished at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center. COE researchers and health education specialists bring the science of our cancer center into minority and medically-underserved communities through public programs and collaborations.
In conjunction with selected public libraries in the Western New York area, and led by experienced members of Roswell Parkâ€™s Community Outreach and Engagement Team, this three-pronged project will provide tailored lay education about the importance of diverse populations participating in clinical research. The first two prongs of this project aim to increase the publicâ€™s knowledge of participating in clinical research. The third prong of this project will provide training to public librarians on the basic tenets of clinical research, as well as demonstrate high quality resources (for locating clinical trials) that librarians can direct laypersons to. This project will include 4 public offerings of a pilot-tested presentation called â€œDonâ€™t be Left Outâ€ at public libraries: two presentations will be held at a public library in a traditionally underserved neighborhood in the city of Buffalo for English speakers; two presentations will be held at a public library serving predominantly Spanish-speaking community members (Presentation available in Appendix A). To enhance public librariansâ€™ knowledge of clinical research tenets and the need to engage diverse populations, a series of one-time staff trainings for public librarians will be held at 2 self-selected public libraries in the Roswell Parkâ€™s catchment area (Presentation available in Appendix B). In total, this proposed project will offer 6 in-person programs at 2 or more public libraries.

20591	1800.0	LILRC Hospital Library Services Program Fifth Annual Conference: Graphic Medicine: Bridging Communication, Empathy, and Creativity in Health Sciences Librarianship	Graphic medicine, or the overlap of comics and healthcare, has emerged over the past decade from a once small, sporadically discussed idea to a burgeoning field of study and subgenre in its own right. For librarians, the growth of the field - which includes a National Library of Medicine exhibit, &quot;Graphic Medicine: Ill-Conceived and Well Drawn!&quot; - presents numerous opportunities, ranging from reinvigorating interest in physical collections to interactive programming. This talk invites librarians to consider how libraries can use comics to encourage better communication, greater empathy, and a focus on creativity in the health sciences. Copies of a graphic medicine book (title to be determined) will be distributed to continue engagement in a future book discussion for participants.

With funding from this grant, the Library plans to launch a eight-month Be Well Nampa project for the primary objective of improving the quality of life in our community. Our goal is to enhance access to existing health services by offering the Library as a centralized, neutral location. The project will employ four primary outreach methods; provide individualized treatment and referral services with professional
healthcare workers and educators; increase access to reliable online health information at our Be Well Nampa library computer center; offer a variety of health and fitness classes and events led by certified health practitioners and; develop an information campaign to promote awareness of the rise in sexually transmitted diseases in our area.

The City of Nampa is one of the more impoverished and underserved communities in Idaho. Be Well Nampa will make use of key partnerships to create an innovative approach to offering health, medical and wellness information to our residents. By using the Library as a central location, the public will be able to consult with healthcare providers, use on-line resource and attend interactive workshops on nutrition, weight loss, fitness and other needed wellness related topics. By providing bilingual services and training library staff, we will be better prepared to lead patrons to accurate, current and relevant
health and medical resources."

21798	6500.0	Assessment Award: That's My Medicine: Empowering Seniors to Identify and Utilize Personalized Health Information Online	Thatâ€™s My Medicine: Empowering Seniors to Identify and Utilize Personalized Health Information Online supports NLMâ€™s missions to promote seniorâ€™s health literacy and knowledge of personalized medicine. As the general public becomes increasingly comfortable and dependent on online resources, it is necessary to ensure that pursuing online health information resources is both accurate and timely. Seniors are particularly vulnerable to polypharmacy, the use of multiple medications.  Therefore, it becomes imperative to promote optimal medication use within this population through personalized medicine and to empower informed decision-making. By motivating seniors to identify and utilize quality health information, we can empower them to make more informed health-related decisions. Seniors will also develop an understanding and expectation that their pharmacotherapy will be tailored to their needs through advancements in personalized medicine such as pharmacogenomics. Likewise, NLM resources have recently faced cutbacks for important medication-related information including ToxNet and decreased updates for PillBox. Characterizing the clinical utility of these resources for the public is essential. Our proposal is a needs assessment to determine 1) the current comfort and skill level of seniors navigating NLM medication-related resources 2) knowledge and attitudes of seniors toward personalized medicine and 3) determine the opportunities and barriers of community librarians for offering medication-related services using open-access health resources. While our assessment is specifically geared participants greater than 65 years of age in Southern Idaho and will occur at local libraries and community centers, we believe the findings will be applicable to a larger, nationwide, â€œprogram in a boxâ€ for navigating open-access medication resources and educating the public on personalized medicineâ€™s potential impact on optimizing their medication list.

PRC staff propose to promote awareness and improved health by developing a consumer health and health literacy-training module for public health librarians in the Brooklyn Public Library System. To reach as many Brooklyn Public Librarians as possible, we plan to conduct two three-hour courses to take place at Brooklyn Public Library locations on March 4, 2020, and April 8, 2020. This project is important as a search of bibliographic literature revealed few studies of the general health consumer populationâ€™s ability to access and use high-quality data online health information (1â€“3). The module will include lectures, small group break-out sessions, audience participation, and a LibGuide outlining consumer health issues and Medicare/Medicaid resources. Additionally we will administer a pre-and post-test survey to participants to gauge effectiveness of the program. 

The first half of each session of the program will concentrate on the special characteristics of conducting reference interviews with individuals who have health questions. A recent study discussed the importance of face-to-face reference services when discussing health matters (2).  The second half of each session will focus on the importance of health literacy and the impact low health literacy has on society (4â€“7). After delivery of the training sessions, we will develop an asynchronous, online CE course for medical, public, and other information professionals looking to improve their consumer health and health literacy skills to provide enhanced services to their patrons. We propose to seek CE credit approval for the online course from the Medical Library Association (MLA) and for it to count toward the Consumer Health Information Specialization (CHIS) curriculum.

23449	19891.0	Mother Goose on the Loose - Goslings	"The Mother Goose on the Looseâ€“Goslings program (Goslings) was developed to address the need for early language and literacy intervention for medically complex infants and the need for additional parental support in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).1 The program has two primary goals: (1) provide parents with the knowledge, skills and tools to promote early language and literacy through talking, reading, singing and reciting nursery rhymes to their infants; and (2) emphasize the bidirectionality of parentâ€“infant communication by informing parents how to interpret and sensitively respond to infant signals that indicate to a caregiver the infantâ€™s needs and readiness for interaction.

A recent study revealed that Goslings is highly successful in meeting its goals.2 Three major themes emerged from the quantitative and qualitative data. First, the program provided parents with the guidance and materials to promote early language and literacy. Second, the program increased parentsâ€™ confidence in interpreting their infantsâ€™ signals of readiness for interaction. Third, parentsâ€™ intentions to implement what they learned from Goslings increased significantly from their reported behaviors prior to the program. Among those parents interviewed one to two weeks following the program, there was a reported increase in engagement in early language and literacy activities, especially talking and singing to their infants in ways that were responsive to their infantsâ€™ signals and medical status. The purpose of this project is to use the results from this study to revise the Goslings Song and Rhyme Booklet, create a Goslings Instructional Guide, develop a web-based Goslings registration and information page, and to convene a focus group of parents and professionals to obtain feedback prior to finalizing the materials. At the conclusion of the project, the Goslings Song and Rhyme Booklet and Goslings Instructional Guide will be accessible, at no charge, on the NNLM.gov website."

25117	19327.0	Health literacy outreach to underserved populations	"Margaret Zimmerman, an Assistant Professor with the University of Iowaâ€™s (UI) School of Library and Information Science (SLIS) requests a grant for a third iteration of her pilot program to develop and implement a health literacy training for immigrant and refugee women living in Iowa. This grant will build upon Dr. Zimmermanâ€™s current successful project employing SLIS graduate students to deliver a health literacy course to immigrant and refugee women. Based upon the findings of the current pilot, Dr. Zimmerman will implement the curriculum she developed over the past two years to rural populations in public libraries. So far, the project has been extremely successful, resulting in statistically significant gains on health literacy assessments for the participants, as well as two conference presentations and an article that is under review- with plans for another to follow when the current pilot is complete. This new project is a three-tiered program meant to be the final phase in creating and testing this curriculum for efficacy. Selecting two public libraries with large local Latinx immigrant and refugee populations, Dr. Zimmerman will first give an instructional workshop to public librarians on using and promoting NLMâ€™s consumer health information resources for the benefit of their patrons. Then, in the same public libraries, Dr. Zimmerman will supervise SLIS students delivering the health literacy curriculum to small groups of six to eight women from the local target population. Included in the curriculum is instructional time on utilizing NLM Spanish language and multicultural resources including Health Reach and MedlinePlus. The participants will be pre and post tested to demonstrate the efficacy of the course. Finally, in accordance with research findings that parents reading books to their children learn from them, too, the women will be given Spanish language childrenâ€™s books on topics related to child health and nutrition to thank them for their participation and encourage further education on family health.

25120	19800.0	Stimulating Minds and Memories: Community Health Partnerships for Memory Care 	"The proposed project entitled â€œStimulating Minds and Memories: Community Health Partnerships for Memory Careâ€ focuses on underserved health communities and underrepresented populations in the state of Michigan to create more dementia-friendly library outreach. The Wayne State University (WSU) School of Information Sciences in Detroit, Michigan, is excited to partner with the Pontiac Public Library to expand library outreach by offering new programs for individuals experiencing memory loss and their caregivers. As the aging population in Michigan is expected to increase, public libraries can play an important role in creating more age-friendly and dementia-friendly library programs to meet this growing need. 
For example, Memory CafÃ©s are designed as safe and welcoming gathering spaces to support the information and social needs of this target population. The health information outreach award will enable the Pontiac Public Library to host a series of Memory CafÃ©s to stimulate conversation among attendees, share experiences, and gather information resources. In addition, this award will help to build the Libraryâ€™s collection of materials designed to facilitate memory recall, such as illustrated books, brain puzzles, and memory care kits. Further, the project provides a unique opportunity for library science students at WSU to gain hands-on experience with developing library programs and community outreach. Overall, the proposed community health partnership supports NNLMâ€™s mission to improve the public&#039;s access to health information for underserved and underrepresented communities.

The books incorporate MedlinePlus, MedlinePlus for Kids, and MedlinePlus for Teens information as well as other National Library of Medicine resources. Minwanjige, Mino Bimaadizi books are crafted with Native American children in mind but also designed to be widely appreciated and raise cultural awareness across many audiences. Native American communities and cultures are sources of strength that can aid in healing and improving the livelihood of Native Americans. By respectfully incorporating Ojibwe (a large tribe in the northern U.S.) culture and language, Minwanjige, Mino Bimaadizi heightens awareness of food-associated factors that contribute to physical and emotional health. Native Americans live with some of the nationâ€™s most significant health disparities. While the causes are immensely complex, it is widely recognized that food insecurity, associated food behaviors, and malnutrition are major influences. Obesity is one outcome of poor diet and unavailability of healthy, nutritious foods. Adult health is often associated with childhood health. Native Americans have the highest prevalence of both childhood and adult obesity. Adults also have significant prevalence of and the highest mortality rates from diabetes and cardiovascular disease, often resulting from poor diet and common comorbidities of obesity. By providing access to trustworthy up to date information, Minwanjige, Mino Bimaadizi empowers Native Americans to take better control of their health and make more informed food-associated decisions early in life while supporting caregivers in facilitating healthful eating. Minwanjige, Mino Bimaadizi books are available as National Networks of Libraries of Medicine repository resources. Printed books are available free of charge by the University of Minnesota Medical School Duluth Campus.

These programs have expanded and built upon each other and used partnerships and connections towards providing equal access to biomedical information to all U.S. health professionals and the use of scientific evidence to guide healthcare decision making. The need for educational opportunities persists, however, according to a 2012 report in which the University of Michigan found that approximately 64% of public health RNs agreed that â€œthey would like more opportunities for training and professional development.â€1  In phases one and two, the  Nursing Experts: Translating the Evidence (NExT) project continued our long tradition of enhancing professional practice by educating public health nurses on where to find free and reliable government resources, how to successfully use them for their specific information needs, and how to translate the information into practice.2 Survey data from the NExT project indicates that 68% of participants in the online course would like additional educational opportunities from the NExT team. In addition, the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) Magnet Recognition ProgramÂ® requires hospitals to use evidence-based practice (EBP) in nursing. Nurses need to document and demonstrate that they engage in research and implement EBP to enhance healthcare quality, improve patient outcomes, and reduce costs. However, despite the explosion of scientific evidence, evidence-based care is not standard of care. Recent surveys of magnet facilities and acute/ambulatory care nurses found low rates of EBP implementation in U.S. health care settings and nurses with insufficient knowledge to meet any of the 24 defined EBP competencies.3,4 Building on the success of our initial phases, in the third phase of this project, the NExT team has four objectives:  1) Expand the online NExT module website to include evidence-based practice content applicable to acute and ambulatory care nurses while continuing outreach to public health nurses, 2) provide Continuing Education Units (CEUs) for practicing acute/ambulatory care and public health nurses, 3) assure completed content meets responsive design best practices, adjusting to various screen sizes on mobile devices, tablets and computers from multiple manufacturers, and 4) promote the online materials to increase awareness and use by all nurses.  Without interruption, UIC has continued its support of the materials created since 2001 and will continue to support the online NExT portal at http://phnext.uic.edu.
25130	19975.0	Lyme Disease:  A Community-Based Citizen Education Project	Lyme Disease (LD) is an emerging epidemic in the Upper Midwest. Early identification of LD symptoms is paramount to effective medical treatment; knowledge of symptoms, how LD spreads, and receiving immediate medical treatment if you have a bite or suspect you may have a bite. This NLM proposal enhances the previous Ixodes Outreach Project (IOP) at the University of Minnesota Medical School (UMMS) Duluth and was funded from 2017 - 2018 to develop a community-outreach program. The new proposed project, Lyme Disease:  A Community-Based Citizen Education Project (LDCB) will continue with educational activities and the collection of Lyme disease ticks. LDCBâ€™s goal is to promote broad-public awareness of health concerns associated with LD and tick-borne diseases in Minnesota. This goal will be accomplished through educational activities, a citizen-science program, and undergraduate research experiences. Education outreach will target Native American and rural populations and will include presentations at libraries, schools, environmental centers and civic organizations. Workshops will be held to provide in-depth LD information and information on MedlinePlus and the CDC tick-borne disease online reference. Community members (citizen-scientists) will be recruited to participate in Lyme Research and learn how to collect and identify ticks. The  citizen-scientists will each receive a â€œtick kitâ€ which helps identify the Ixodes scapularis tick which contains a tick removal key with the UMMS and NLM logos, tick and LD information card, collection bags, and mailing envelopes for tick submission to the Principal Investigator (PI). Collected ticks will be analyzed by Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) for Borrelia burgdorferi; the bacteria causing LD and the tick gut microbiome will be surveyed by Nanopore technology. Citizen scientists will provide ticks gathered during daily outdoor activities; thereby assisting in identifying areas where the Ixodes ticks are located and determining if the ticks are infected with Borrelia. This information will identify geographic areas where humans are likely to contact infected ticks. A web-based â€œTick Story Mapâ€ (TSM) will further promote LD awareness. This online resource will combine images, video, a series of maps, including a tick-borne disease risk map, and a database for LD and tick-borne disease research. The LDCB will extend the citizen-based research to the discovery of other emerging tick-borne bacterial diseases revealed by the Nanopore technology. Citizen-scientists may review and contribute to the database using an online application to submit information such as weather conditions, date, time of day, vegetation and geographic terrain, and the types of activity when Ixodes tick contact occurred. Citizen-scientists will be encouraged to provide input on data analysis and future experimental design. Undergraduate college students will learn about Ixodes and LD as they gain valuable experience participating in field collections (tick drags), science enrichment activities to systematically survey for Borrelia-infected Ixodes, and performing lab-based PCR analysis and presenting research poster presentations of their work.
25133	19999.0	Empowering High Schoolers to Pursue Public Health Research in Mansfield, Ohio	"Students from Mansfield Senior High School will be guided by public health professionals and librarians to create original public health research projects over the course of the 2020-2021 school year. They will attend 4 workshops on how to research a local public health topic based on the current issues in the community. Participating students will end the school year by presenting a poster and oral presentation to community stakeholders including the Health Commissioner, County Commissioners, Directors of various local health and social service agencies, local business owners and community organizers. Based on a review of relevant programs attempted around the US in the past decade, this kind of program has the potential to increase public health awareness in both the student and general population, as well as increasing college preparedness and community buy-in among participants (see citations below). Intended outcomes include empowering students to set the agenda of their local health department (e.g., program planning, advocacy, data collection methods, stimulating grant proposals), and motivating students to return to Richland County after college to work on public health issues in the area.

25136	19999.0	A Library-based Data Retrieval and Management Training Program for Clinical Researchers	"Enterprise Data Warehouses (EDWs) play an increasingly important role on academic medical campuses, housing clinical and other enterprise-wide data and making it available for research and strategic purposes in the learning health system. Here, we will create an end-to-end training program that introduces clinical researchers to clinical database architecture and clinical coding standards, teaches them how to translate their research questions into queries that will allow them to extract data properly, and how to do so in a way that supports transparency and reproducibility while still respecting guidelines for proper data sharing. This work will build on longstanding partnerships with the leadership and data analysts of the Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse (NMEDW). [1,2] We will work together to promote improved communication and collaboration between data analysts and clinical researchers to make them better partners in research projects. To promote reusability of research reports and database queries within Northwesternâ€™s research community, we will provide workflows for preservation through our next-generation research data management (RDM) system to make these resources discoverable. Our ultimate goal is to bolster support for our local research community to use clinical research data from the NMEDW and also parlay this experience to develop a blueprint of best practice workflows for clinical research data education and training that could be applied in libraries at other institutions.

25201	19999.0	Information Collaboration: Bringing Public Health Organizations and Public Libraries Together â€“ Phase II	Phase II of the Information Collaboration project will focus on developing and implementing a training and outreach program that targets the public library and public health workforce. The goal of the program will be to foster sustainable partnerships aimed at improving the publicâ€™s health through information access. The development of this project will be informed by the data collected and analyzed during the Phase I project. Initial data tells us there is great interest from both public library and public health workers in collaborating, but barriers prevent the development and sustainability of long-term partnerships. Qualitative data gathered during focus group sessions identifies some of the key barriers as a lack of understanding in what public health or public libraries do, funding constraints that prevent sustainable relationships, uncertainty around key priorities and who should be involved in relationship development. Recognizing the importance of leadership involvement, this project will emphasis programming at an administrative level. As such, we plan to develop a webinar series targeted to both public health and public library leaders. Additionally, a toolkit will be created and made available that will cover a range of topics, such as: Priorities in Public Health/Public Libraries; How to Create and Sustain Partnerships; Building Relationships into Strategy and Mission; Finding Funding; and Emerging Public Health Issues. To engage the public library and public health workforce on a deeper level, this project will also implement a Community of Practice for at least five  public library and public health leaders. The Community of Practice will be designed to give participants the ability to exchange ideas, amplify success stories, and learn from each other on topics related to long-term collaboration. Outcomes from the Community of Practice will provide direction for a sustainable program that targets a larger audience of public library and public health leaders across the country. Finally, this project will build in evaluation targets that examine the impact of the training sessions and the development of public library and public health partnerships.
25398	19999.0	Training Mental Health Outpatient Clinics on Promising Practices for LGBT Care	Bradbury-Sullivan LGBT Community Center will develop a program that provides training to the staff, clinicians, and administrators of 6 outpatient mental health clinics in Eastern Pennsylvania on promising practices for providing affirming mental health care to the LGBT community. The training will encompass implications for practice, minority stressors, barriers to care, and the increased rates of trauma within the LGBT population. The training, designed to benefit both LGBT patients and clinicians, will welcome attendee engagement, discuss specific clinician concerns and scenarios in achieving LGBT-affirming care, and connect clinics to resources available through MedlinePlus. This project is critical to reduce two staggering disparities affecting our community: mental wellness and access to comprehensive, welcoming care. 
25450	19853.0	RESILIENT Workshops: REady Steady In the Library: taking Initiative before an Emergency, Natural disaster, or Trauma	The RESILIENT Workshops (REady Steady In the Library: taking Initiative before an Emergency, Natural disaster, or Trauma) present a curriculum of self-paced learning and online workshops curated from existing federal and state materials that will support and empower library staff and improve library resiliency in the preparation, response, and recovery phases of an emergency or disaster in their libraries or communities. The immediate outcomes of this project will be: 1) that library staff will learn or improve their knowledge and skills for self-care and communication and will be able to identify and share the freely available resources on health, mental health, and disaster planning resources from NLM and other federal and state agencies; and 2) that library directors / operations managers will develop plans for two types of emergencies and disasters in their libraries and communities and will develop a communication plan for emergencies and disasters. The project will be led by Southeastern New York Library Resources Council (Southeastern), a non-profit library consortium located sixty miles north of New York City that has served libraries, library systems, and institutions with library or archival holdings across an eight-county area for more than fifty years. We anticipate this project will directly impact 200 people. However, participantsâ€™ increase in knowledge and skills will have an exponentially positive impact on the communities of participating libraries before, during, and after emergencies or disasters.

This project will create a national model to guide the Libraries Without Borders WALI-Health program, which delivers library services and programs in laundromats. This project seeks to expand WALI-Health by increasing the capacity of libraries, small business owners, and community partners to develop tailored outreach projects that reach low-income populations, many of which are underrepresented in biomedical research communities. Libraries Without Borders will establish a working group that will create a set of tools, data, and best-practices that would enable any library to launch a WALI-Health program on their own.
25468	3662.0	Exploring Health & Wellness at the Norwin Public Library	"We believe the public library can offer more than research-based learning and recreation such as books, movies, music; it can offer emotional and psychological learning, acceptance and mindfulness. Working with several local partners, our library will engage our families in a waide variety of health programming, and integrate health information into our services. To supplement these programs, we will direct patrons towards KidsHealth.org, GirlsHealth.gov, HealthyChildren.org, and other trusted resources.

We will work with the local Childrenâ€™s Institute to teach children about living with disabilities with a program called KIDS ON THE BLOCK, which opens up a dialogue of acceptance through the use of puppets. We will also welcome in a healthcare educator to meet with preteen girls and discuss menstruation. A local yoga studio will teach mindfulness and yoga techniques to children from ages 5-12 as a way to combat stress and deal with emotions. And lastly, being able to offer more sensory storytimes for children who may be overwhelmed by a traditional storytime setting has always been important to our library; we&#039;d relish the chance to be more inclusive by purchasing some manipulatives and toys to create a safer, more welcoming space. 

As we are not yet aware when public libraries across the State of PA will be able to hold any sort of in-house programming, we will work closely with our partners to adapt programming to be virtually accessible. We at the library have a Zoom subscription, which can easily be used by presenters. "

25546	4972.0	Library Project 8: Teaching Information Literacy and Evidence-Based Practice Skills to Graduate Nursing Students via Asynchronous Interactive Online Tutorials	Brenau University is introducing a new entry-level masters of science in nursing.  Evidence-based practice, an essential element of providing high-quality healthcare, is a core concept of the curriculum. To learn evidence-based practice skills, students have to be explicitly taught how to locate, access, evaluate, and apply healthcare research information. This project will integrate these required information literacy skills into the new nursing curriculum through asynchronous, interactive online tutorials. The tutorials will work in tandem with assignments in evidence-based practice classes, mutually reinforcing course content and information literacy skills. This project will ensure that nursing graduates are literate in health information, leading to a general improvement in evidence-based practice in the Southeastern healthcare workforce. Completed tutorials and process for course integration will be made available to other programs serving healthcare students, increasing the impact beyond Brenauâ€™s students.  
25556	15000.0	Mental Health and Substance Use During COVID-19	"The COVID-19 pandemic is disproportionately impacting vulnerable minority communities through its strain on social systems and burden on individuals.  This burden is creating a significant and unmet need for mental illness and substance use disorder outreach and support.  This campaign provides easily accessible, culturally appropriate information to vulnerable populations in the district through a multimedia campaign conducted through means compatible with social distancing guidelines.  During May, June, July, and August of 2020, this campaign will work within predominantly minority communities to develop and disseminate relevant content centered around the themes of mental health and substance use during a pandemic.  To reach new audiences in their homes, Grapevine Health will produce and market a video miniseries based on NLM materials primarily through organic social media connections.  Additionally, to drive community interest and engagement, Grapevine Health will collaborate with subject matter experts and individuals who have personally struggled with addiction to create a series of varied podcast experiences.  Audience engagement and retention will be driven through regular analysis and adjustment of outreach strategy based on community response, as well as in accordance with shifting COVID-19 guidelines.

This project serves NLMâ€™s mission by significantly increasing the access of underserved minority populations to culturally-appropriate and relevant health information.  This campaign aims to inspire long-term behavioral changes by integrating into the daily routines of communities who will likely benefit from interactions with health care communications catered to their unique needs.  Additionally, all content developed during this campaign will remain accessible online beyond the duration of the funding period and may be adapted for use in other communities.

This will enable them to make informed decisions about their health. 
The library will purchase and install reliable and up to date computer workstations and configure each with specialized portals to access reliable National Library of Medicine resources. These resources will target populations in the counties we serve with online health information that is culturally sensitive, and relevant to our diverse community, consisting of approximately 40% African-Americans and members of the Chickahominy Tribe and other local native Americans and an over-65 population of 21%. 
Heritage Public Library will cultivate partnerships will local health providers and local groups such as the Alzheimerâ€™s Association, Senior Navigator, Triad, New Kent Outreach Committee, the VCU Health New Kent Emergency Center, and Charles City Countyâ€™s HEAL (Healthy Eating and Active Living) Campaign to make them aware of what the library provides and to promote National Library of Medicine resources. 
Heritage Public Library will use a set of class laptops to train community members to find and evaluate reliable health information. Using laptops, library staff will train community members both inside the library buildings and in other community locations. 
Heritage public Library is a small institution with a limited budget so we are not able to provide a comprehensive print health collection. We follow the principle that it is better to have nothing in print on the shelf on a topic rather than erroneous or out of date information, so we are not able to meet all our patrons&#039; needs for health information in print. To improve public health it is vital that we promote, direct patrons to, and train patrons on an authoritative and up to date health source like MedlinePlus from the National Library of Medicine."
25652	19979.0	Expanding Knowledge and Awareness for Hepatitis B and Liver Cancer for Underserved Communities in Greater Philadelphia 	Hepatitis B is an infection that can be acute (short-term) or chronic (lifelong) that is often not reported or identified. In the United States, there are approximately 2.2 million individuals living with chronic hepatitis B and over 30,000 in Philadelphia, PA. If left undiagnosed, hepatitis B (HBV) can lead to scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), or even liver cancer over time. Hepatitis B is vaccine-preventable but currently, acute hepatitis B rates are rising across the country in connection with the rise of injection drug use and a portion of those (approximately 10%) will result in chronic infections. In the United States, only 25% of people are aware of their hepatitis B infection and majority of the population remains undiagnosed. People who share needles, inject and use drugs, people with more than one sex partner, men who have sex with men (MSM), and people who were born or have parents from endemic parts of the world (Africa, Asia, Western Pacific), individuals with diabetes, and those immunocompromised are recommended by CDC to receive the HBV vaccine. Despite the availability of a vaccine, only approximately 25% of adults above the age of 18 are protected against HBV through vaccination. To reduce morbidity and mortality due to liver cancers in underserved communities particularly African immigrant, Asian and Pacific Islander and refugee communities and persons who use drugs in Greater Philadelphia, the Hepatitis B Foundation (HBF) and itsâ€™ local coalition, Hep B United Philadelphia will collaborate to conduct culturally and linguistically competent, community-based education events in the Philadelphia region.  HBF will oversee the coordination of the proposed project and bring its HBV and liver cancer expertise to the project. HBF was established in 1991 and itsâ€™s local coalition in 2007, and since inception has educated over 20,000 Philadelphians on HBV. There is a need to expand based on community-identified needs and target populations that are traditionally underserved. The goals of this project are to focus on significantly underserved populations to 1) Improve knowledge and access to health information about hepatitis B and liver cancer in high-risk populations in Greater Philadelphia to improve overall awareness and 2) Expand knowledge of hepatitis B into new priority populations through the creation of culturally competent materials and resources and distribute those resources to at least 600 people considered to be high-risk for hepatitis B in Greater Philadelphia.

25717	3256.0	Building FAIR Habits: Pilot FAIR Data Workshop for Data Novices	"This is a train-the-trainer project on FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data basics for data novices. The overall concept is to meet data novices at their comfort levels, in order to increase workforce awareness of open science and FAIR data. We propose to hold a workshop on FAIR data habits for librarians new to thinking about data. Librarians will then pilot small conversation starters with patrons new to FAIR data, and share back insights on whether that appears to have benefitted their patrons. Workshop content will be edited based on feedback, and shared as an open educational resource.
 
The workshop will focus on spreadsheet data for assessment and quality improvement studies. Workshop students will be librarians in non-data-specialist roles. Workshop lessons will use examples from library assessment to illustrate how FAIR practices apply to their own data. By using these familiar examples, the workshop will train librarians to understand how spreadsheet-based data can become FAIR and open. The workshop will then explain how library assessment examples can transfer to understanding health data collection such as quality improvement and basic clinical studies. The familiar library data will serve as a bridge for understanding health assessment and health research data.
 
From there, the librarian students will reach out to their patrons to start conversations about one aspect of FAIR data. Discussion groups with the project PIs will support the librarians in their efforts. This train-the-trainer pilot will support and assess the concept of non-data librarians building basic FAIR habits among patrons. This approach will build open science literacy and fundamental awareness of FAIR across a wide range of the base of the health data workforce.

The familiar library data will serve as a bridge for understanding health assessment and health research data.

From there, the librarian students will reach out to their patrons to start conversations about one aspect of FAIR data. Discussion groups with the project PIs will support the librarians in their efforts. This train-the-trainer pilot will support and assess the concept of non-data
librarians building basic FAIR habits among patrons. This approach will build open science literacy and fundamental awareness of FAIR across a wide range of the base of the health data workforce."
25723	7390.0	Building FAIR Habits: Pilot FAIR Data Workshop for Data Novices	"This is a train-the-trainer project on FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data basics for data novices. The overall concept is to meet data novices at their comfort levels, in order to increase workforce awareness of open science and FAIR data. We propose to hold a workshop on FAIR data habits for librarians new to thinking about data. Librarians will then pilot small conversation starters with patrons new to FAIR data, and share back insights on whether that appears to have benefitted their patrons. Workshop content will be edited based on feedback, and shared as an open educational resource.
 
The workshop will focus on spreadsheet data for assessment and quality improvement studies. Workshop students will be librarians in non-data-specialist roles. Workshop lessons will use examples from library assessment to illustrate how FAIR practices apply to their own data. By using these familiar examples, the workshop will train librarians to understand how spreadsheet-based data can become FAIR and open. The workshop will then explain how library assessment examples can transfer to understanding health data collection such as quality improvement and basic clinical studies. The familiar library data will serve as a bridge for understanding health assessment and health research data.

25806	20000.0	Interprofessional Infant Oral Health Education at the Community Engagement Center 	Dental caries (i.e., tooth decay) can cause severe pain that prevents children from eating and sleeping. Despite the significant negative impact that caries can have on childrenâ€™s well-being, health professionals often do not provide families with the information they need to keep their children cavity-free. A major contributor to this gap in preventive dental care is a lack of awareness on the part of healthcare professionals about the child dental health resources that are available through the NIH U.S. National Library of Medicine (NNLM). The proposed Infant Oral Health Program will bridge this gap by offering interprofessional education on infant-toddler oral health to health professions trainees in dentistry, medicine, nursing, and social work, who provide care to families in Homewood, a low-income and predominantly African-American community in Pittsburgh, PA. Our objective is to familiarize health professionals with NNLM resources that will equip them with the information they need to provide preventive oral health education to families with infants and toddlers. Thus, the Infant Oral Health Program simultaneously will increase the use of NNLM child dental health education materials by professionals from multiple pediatric healthcare fields while improving access to infant oral health information for disadvantaged families.
25809	19692.0	Helping Empower Adolescents Learning Through Health (HEALTH) Info	Helping Empower Adolescents Learning Through Health (HEALTH) Info aims to provide local high school students with the knowledge and skills necessary to empower others within their school and community to address health disparities. High school students from underrepresented populations going into their junior or senior year will be recruited from public and charter high schools across Philadelphia.  This program will utilize the Project SHARE curriculum, which was developed by the University of Maryland. Students will attend a four-day summer training conducted by the Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences at Temple University.  In addition to learning about health disparities, participants will be exposed to a diverse set of health careers in public health. Participants will learn how teams of health professionals work together to solve complex health issues. At the end of the training, participants will develop an action plan to implement within their schools or communities.  From the completion of the training through December, program staff will conduct bimonthly follow ups with participants to provide technical assistance and support in helping them achieve their program related goals.
25837	19999.0	 Community Outreach on Respiratory Hazards and Illnesses in Southwestern Pennsylvania	According to the American Lung Association&#039;s 2019 &quot;State of the Air&quot; report, Pittsburghâ€™s air quality was ranked the 7th worst in the country. Poor air quality threatens the health of Southwestern Pennsylvanians, especially vulnerable populations, such as older adults and those living with infectious lung diseases. This project proposes to give residents of Southwestern Pennsylvania accurate, timely, and useful information and guidance on how they can protect themselves and their families. To do this, EHP will educate the public on respiratory hazards and illnesses in their community; offer free health resources and mobilize community partnerships and leaders to use those resources to educate others; and disseminate resources, such as MedlinePlus and Tox Town, and information that link people to other health services.
25840	19992.0	BGH Connect	Black Girl Health Foundationâ€™s â€œBGH Connectâ€ is a digital campaign that includes upgrading the Black Girl Health (BGH) Membership Portal to include new content, and a social media marketing campaign designed to attract two hundred (200) new women in Designated Market Areas (DMAs) and urban cores with high populations of African Americans; these shall encompass metropolitan Delaware (Wilmington and Dover), New Jersey (East Orange, Newark, and Trenton), New York (Hempstead, New York, and Mount Vernon), and Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and the Capitol Region (Harrisburg). This campaign will allow us to welcome more women of color (an underserved population) to our online health and wellness Membership Platform, and expand our online offerings â€” thus increasing the amount of health information we disseminate to our Members. In addition to new fitness plans, we will create new health and wellness guides informed by NLM resources such as MedlinePlus. Guide topics may include, but are not limited to: how to read nutrition labels, disease prevention, a healthy eating recipe booklet, internal health equals external beauty, etc. A December 2020 launch is designed to encourage women to get &#039;Fit and Fabulous in 2021&#039;. This project contributes to the mission of the National Network of Libraries of Medicine (NNLM) by â€œimproving individualsâ€™ access to information to enable them to make informed decisions about their healthâ€, and â€œincreasing engagement with research and dataâ€.
25845	19999.0	Clearing the Air: Educating the Camden Community about Air Quality and Respiratory Health	The purpose of this project is to provide the people of Camden, New Jersey with environmental health information that will help them understand the links between the air quality in their community and their respiratory health. The Cooper Medical School of Rowan University (CMSRU)Library is planning a community outreach program that educates members of the public about the impact that air quality has on health in general, and its specific role in triggering asthma and other respiratory diseases. This health information will be presented in easy-to-understand, user-friendly ways that will make it accessible to all: The centerpiece of the project will be a free, public website that showcases National Library of Medicine information resources such as MedlinePlus and Tox Town. Additionally, there will be a series of expert-led environmental-health community events that can, in order to best meet the needs of attendees, be delivered either as in-person seminars or as teleconferences.
25849	17063.0	From Snake Oil to Social Media: Pharmaceutical Advertising and Medication Literacy for Health Care Consumers	Direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) for prescription drugs has been an ongoing, contentious issue in the United States. Despite oversight from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and a call from the American Medical Association (AMA) to ban DTCA, pharmaceutical manufactures continue to spend over six billion dollars annually on consumer-facing television, print, and internet advertising.1,2 This educational initiative brings together librarians and archivists from Weill Cornell Medicineâ€™s (WCM) Samuel J Wood Library and pharmacists from New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell to create an asynchronous interactive webpage-based online workshop on historical and modern methods of pharmaceutical advertising, enduring issues in medication regulation and safety, and the ongoing importance of patient engagement, advertising &amp; medication literacy. Created using the Drupal content management platform, the workshop website will be hosted within the WCM Libraryâ€™s webpage and will feature text narratives, video vignettes, timelines, and images, including exposure to digitized 19th century historical medical trade cards and interactive guided analysis of modern advertising practices. Insights and imagery drawn from WCMâ€™s archival collections will be juxtaposed against those found in modern day pharmaceutical advertisements. This digital content will culminate with resources to bolster participantsâ€™ advertising and medication literacy including, presenting key questions consumers should ask when viewing medication advertisements,  reputable consumer-focused online drug information sources from the National Library of Medicine (NLM) and the FDA, and methods to facilitate discussions with their health care provider, pharmacist, or librarian.  
25855	4565.0	Valley Mental Health First Aid Responders	This project will provide Shenango Valley residents with the resources and instruction necessary to become mental health first aid responders. The project is twofold in that there will be training sessions for members of the community as well as library staff members, and that this grant will cover the cost of purchasing library materials that cover mental health. The project will start with a training on how to help adults in a mental health crisis and then a training on how to help youth that are dealing with a mental health crisis. Participants will be given NNLM resources such as Caring for the Mind: Mental Health Resources for Library Patrons and MedlinePlus Basics brochures. The grant will also include Caring for the Mind training for library staff, provided by NNLM staff. Additionally, the library will purchase books to add to our collection on mental health which will increase the publicâ€™s access to this information.  Due to issues and complications raised by the coronavirus, the library would like to add a virtual component to the project. We would like to offer the Mental Health First Aid as a virtual program - to not only ensure the safety of all attendees and instructors, but also to allow for greater participation. This alternative plan will necessitate additional training of our Mercer County Behavioral Health instructors, adding $300 ($150 each), plus possibly an increase per attendee, to the program budget. However, we feel that this is the best course of action in order to meet or surpass our goal of 30 participants. There are many mental health issues being reported due to current quarantine and stay-athome orders, and we feel that our program will be in greater demand because of these issues. Making the programs virtual will allow the library to expand the class limit without dealing with social distancing rules. Follow-ups after the Mental Health First Aid courses will be done through a Doodle survey where attendees can voice their opinions on the relevancy of the training as well as what parts of the curriculum were the most helpful and least helpful. We will also make personal phone calls to attendees in the spring to follow up with resources that they may need, answer questions, or help with other issues. These actions will help ensure that the training has a lasting effect and create sustainability. 
25903	18242.0	Open Educational Resources for Allied Health Professions and Health Sciences	The proposed project is intended to support the sustainable creation, adaptation, and use of Open Educational Resources (OER) in allied health professions and health sciences fields at large. Our faculty fellowship is designed to include training in relevant health sciences resources from the NNLM, training in OER authorship and use, and support in using the resources from the NNLM to create OER. Faculty fellows will meet monthly with the OER Librarian to work on their OER project and monthly as a group (facilitated by the OER Librarian) to discuss OER theory and advocacy in order to create a community of practice where they can find support. We will also hold a librarian training, which will cover how to assist faculty in adopting, adapting, and authoring OER; how to establish and maintain faculty partnerships; and how to advocate for OER. We will deliver this program to Touro College librarians, but the materials will be made openly available afterward, so that other libraries can hold their own program; we will incorporate NNLM materials into this training. 
25906	14979.0	BGH Minds Matter D.C.	"Black Girl Health Foundationâ€™s  â€œMinds Matter D.C.â€ is a program in partnership with the Washington, D.C. Public Library System designed to reach out to women of color in the Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Virginia area (collectively known as DMV) and educate them about mental health and mental health resources. Black Girl Health (BGH) has already hosted a very successful iteration of Minds Matter in Harrrisburg, PA with the support of the Dauphin County Library System, and we have Minds Matter - NOLA scheduled to take place October 10th, 2020 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Although â€œMinds Matterâ€ is typically held as an in-person event in partnership with a cityâ€™s regional library system, BGH is hosting â€œMinds Matter D.C.â€ as an online event. In the wake of the COVID-19 Pandemic, a lack of certainty about the end or extension of quarantining and social distancing requirements, and civil unrest, offering digital health literacy regarding mental health couldnâ€™t be more timely and crucial. To transition all in-person workshops (originally scheduled to be held at the Washington, D.C. Public Library) into digital workshops, a video/streaming event will air live on social media via a special â€˜Minds Matter D.C.â€™ Facebook Group, and a recorded version will be hosted on the Washington, D.C. Public Library website. Both BGH College Ambassadors assisting with the program and workshop participants will learn how the NLM resource â€œMedlinePlusâ€ is a powerful tool for learning about and managing mental health. While the campaign and workshops increase access to mental health information, the evaluations obtained at the close of workshops may provide valuable biomedical information pertaining to the mental health beliefs and concerns of a historically underserved demographic.

25909	14587.0	Health Information and Career Awareness Program	Southern Alabama Area Health Education Center (SAAHEC) strives to grow the next generation of medical professionals to serve the people of Alabama, train health profession students and provide health information and  education to the communities in our 10 counties. The Health Information and Career Awareness Program (HICAP) contributes to the mission of National Network of Libraries of Medicine (NNLM) by improving our communitiesâ€™ access and awareness of health information and enabling them to make informed decisions about their health. It will enable SAAHEC to become a community engagement partner and champion for the All of Us program in our communities. Additionally, HICAP will expand our current programs (pipeline, health profession students (AHEC Scholars), and community outreach) to incorporate National Library of Medicine (NLM) health and science materials and All of Us community resources in our training, presentations and community engagements. It will engage students in grades 9-12, college and communities in rural and under-served areas throughout our service area. Initially, the program will be implemented in two (2) of our rural counties in Southern Alabama (Butler and Escambia) and one (1) urban county (Mobile) and will eventually expand to the rest of our service area. The program will access Medline Plusâ€™ health career information, health promotion and disease prevention resources to enrich the one (1) hour classroom presentations that we already provide to high schools in our service area. It will create health literate 9-12 graders who are able to access, navigate, obtain and understand health information and use it to make informed decisions about their health as well as making them aware of the numerous health career options available to them. Additionally, the HICAP program will utilize our AHEC Scholars to provide outreach education and advance health literacy to the under-served, underrepresented members of our service area. As a part of their community based experiential training hours, our AHEC Scholars already present health information presentations and handouts to homeless clinics, senior citizen communities, and those who are at risk for low health literacy and have limited knowledge regarding quality online consumer health information. This program will be expanded to utilize NLM and All of Us community resources. Specifically, we will train the AHEC Scholars using NLM training resources to locate and evaluate health information and provide awareness of the All of Us program. They will in turn, use those resources in their presentations to the under-served, underrepresented communities we serve.  Further, the program will expand our community outreach by developing health and wellness folders with NLM materials and All of Us community resources to hand out during community events (i.e. career fairs, health fairs, conferences, food pantry events, etc.). This will strengthen our community partnerships and engagements as well as provide bundled health information to youth, health profession students, health care providers, seniors, and veterans.  In consideration of the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing guidelines, we realize we may not be able to provide services in the same manner as before. Therefore, the health and wellness folders can be mailed or information emailed to organizations and schools in the event we canâ€™t interact face to face. Additionally, live presentations and trainings can be done virtually using Video Conferencing Software such as Zoom, Google Meets, or GoToMeeting. Prerecorded video presentations and trainings can also be emailed to community partners and posted to our website and social media accounts. Additionally, Facebook can also be utilized for live presentations and weekly postings as well. These virtual platforms can be used to educate our target audience on how to access NLM resources and improve the understanding and importance of participating in medical research such as All of Us. These same platforms can also be used with the one (1) hour classroom health career presentations with our high schools. Nontraditional ways of delivery can be utilized to enrich and educate the communities in our rural and under-served areas on health information.

25919	15000.0	All of Us In Memphis: Health Outreach with the Connect Crew	Memphis Public Librariesâ€™ six-person outreach team, the Connect Crew, was launched in January 2019. This team travels throughout Memphis and Shelby County to host a robust variety of programming for all ages and learning levels, including some limited health and wellness programs. Our partner agencies, including local schools, community centers, parks, and service providers, have requested additional programming around health literacy and wellness. Because the Connect Crew is a new department for our agency and was established after we piloted All Of Us In Memphis in partnership with NNLM, they have not yet implemented a set curriculum or series of health and wellness programs. This project would formalize the Connect Crewâ€™s health outreach strategy with the needed equipment, supplies, software/apps, and curriculum to reach those who cannot attend traditional library programs. It will also create a health literacy toolkit that can be utilized by the Connect Crew, as well as all 18 MPL neighborhood library locations.

BE WELL addresses local health inequities by prioritizing resources and activities in NPL branches whose neighborhoods have higher rates of chronic disease and less access to healthy living opportunities.   From weekly yoga and Zumba, to cooking classes, meditation and smoking cessation groups, BE WELL at NPL aligns its activities with the local health priority areas outlined in Davidson Countyâ€™s Community Health Needs Assessment.

Embracing its role as a key partner in community health, NPL opens its doors to partner agencies to hold health insurance open enrollment, summer feeding for children, WIC clinics, and social worker drop-ins, with the understanding that many people feel more comfortable accessing assistance in the library than in a clinical setting. This work continues in spite of COVID-19 as the BE WELL at NPL program currently adapts to face these unprecedented times.

25934	6647.0	Mental Health and Well-Being Resources in North Country Libraries	The Mental Health and Well-Being Resources project is designed to increase health literacy and mental health awareness in the North Country Library System, a mostly rural geographic area that consists of four counties in northern New York. The project has two components. The first component consists of increasing the amount of mental health training and resources for library staff and patrons by purchasing online Homeless Librarian training, hosting an Effective Skills for Emotional Wellness training and adding mental health ebooks and audio-books to the NCLS Overdrive collection. The Homeless Librarian training will equip library staff and trustees with the skills needed to interact with library patrons who are experiencing homelessness, mental illness and trauma. The Emotional Wellness training will help library staff manage their stress, mitigate depressive symptoms and relieve anxiety so they can better serve their patrons, staff and families. The purchase of Mental Health ebooks and audiobooks will allow patrons to have access to free mental health titles that they didnâ€™t have access to before. The second part of the project will focus on promoting digital health resources throughout the North Country Library System. Medline Plus and other free online health resources will be promoted though a digital campaign (website and social media) as well through print media such as banners and bookmarks. The NCLS Outreach Coordinator will design and purchase these materials in mass and then distribute them to the member libraries to use in their buildings. In order to effectively promote the resources, The NCLS Outreach Coordinator will also host a series of webinar trainings that highlight the online health resources for member library staff. The training will be conducted through webinars by NNLM staff. This will help insure that staff are familiar with the resources so that they can actively promote them to their patrons. In addition to this, the Outreach Coordinator will develop an expertise of the online health resources provided by the NNLM through archived and scheduled webinars and will participate in future trainings to help sustain the project and effectively promote the resources after the initial grant-funded project year. This individual will also confer with the local county health departments and the local hospital librarian to get a better sense of what the local health issues are. This information will be used to plan and focus future health resource promotion to fit local needs.

Our 3 Steps Detectâ„  education harnesses the power of early detection by teaching people how to recognize early warning signs of cancer and collaborate with doctors to accelerate the time to diagnosis and receive more effective treatment. A critical element of this education is continuity, reinforcement and access to reliable information and advice. Our partnership with the National Network of Libraries of Medicine has allowed for the integration of NNLM/MedLine Plus resources into our 3 Steps Detect education. We deliver this life-saving education to high schools, colleges, community organizations and other high-risk populations, such as firefighters in person, via train-the-trainer methods, and via live webinars.  In all these current delivery methods, MedLine Plus is presented as a credible resource for reliable and up-to-date information regarding doctor/patient relationships, symptoms, confidentiality and patientâ€™s rights. 

With the increased demand for our education in the Northeast and nationally, it necessitates a scalable online delivery method. In August 2019 we began building an eLearning Platform with CoreAxis, an industry leading provider of interactive digital education.  The eLearning Platform will package and distribute our 3 Steps Detect education with a scalable strategy. We have created a 2-minute eLearning Platform preview at: https://youtu.be/anqDGviGkEs

We respectfully request a $7,000 grant toward the integration of MedLine resources into the 2020 buildout of the eLearning Platform including a dedicated module. Being able to access our training 24/7 will reinforce our education, MedLine Plus as a trusted resource, and ensure greater access to valuable health information.

26095	9504.0	Improving Provider Knowledge of HPV to Reduce Cancer on Nantucket & Marthaâ€™s Vineyard	Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the USA. Over 90% of cervical and anal cancers and 75% of oropharyngeal cancer are caused by persistent HPV infection. These infections, and the resultant cancers, can be prevented with vaccination. However, the islands of Marthaâ€™s Vineyard and Nantucket lag far behind the Massachusetts average in their HPV vaccination rates. Because research demonstrates that provider recommendations greatly impact patientâ€™s decisions on vaccination, Team Maureen has educated hundreds of medical and dental providers across the state on HPVâ€™s connection to cancer and their role in prevention. For the first time, Team Maureen will bring this high quality provider education to the communities of Marthaâ€™s Vineyard and Nantucket to ensure that medical and dental providers are well-equipped to discuss HPVâ€™s connection to cancer and the importance of vaccination with their patients. Key to these provider events is the collaboration between medical and dental providers on the Islands. In these smaller island communities, having all providers from the dentist to the family practitioner, using the same language and highlighting the same facts can impact patient behavior.

26101	7000.0	Helping Seniors Take Health Decisions into Their Own Hands	Health information can change quickly. In an underfunded public library, this translates into out of date resources that can misinform consumers. Unfortunately, the capacity of our public computing is insufficient to meet the needs of our community, and therefore directing people to online health resources such as MedlinePlus is a challenge. Additionally, we do not have the staffing capacity to provide instruction on available, accurate resources.  Our residents, and especially our seniors, are unaware of the free, easy, and accurate material available through MedlinePlus. By adding 5 new computers as well as dedicated staff time for instruction and patron support, we will improve the knowledge base of our community and grow their confidence in advocating for their health needs.

We believe that the Charlotte Library is an ideal space for a flexible, mobile kitchen set-up, using the equipment supplies and training materials from the Charlie Cart Project.  The Charlie Cart Project provides a unique and scalable educational program that enables hands-on learning about food, nutrition, and health in any setting. With a comprehensive set of turnkey resources â€“ including a compact mobile kitchen cart on wheels, utensils and cooking equipment, lesson plans, training, and related supports â€“ the Project removes obstacles to implementing critically needed food education and cooking interventions and public libraries are the perfect place to make this happen. As Hillary Dodge said when interviewed about her book &quot;Gather &#039;Round the Table: Food Literacy Programs, Resources and Ideas for Libraries, &quot; Most libraries have a mission, vision and values that are centered around community-making, information access, education, and entertainment.  Food literacy ticks off all of those boxes.&quot;  We are excited to bring food literacy to the Charlotte Library in a more meaningful, accessible and practical way.  Because of our rural location, we are also able to involve local farmers and food producers in this project.  This allows the library to make local foods available to all in our community and provide support for local businesses as well.

26107	7800.0	Virtual Health Education Tour 2020-2021	"HAMA will be conducting its 3rd Health Education Tour from August 2020 â€“ October 2020. The utility of this project stems from the need for more strategic and culturally specific delivery of health information to underserved communities.
Last year, HAMA conducted this project for the second consecutive year. Based on the success of the project and needs assessment obtained through surveys we have decided to repeat this project with the option of in-person or virtual health education sessions. It is our hope that the addition of virtual sessions will help increase our impact in numbers and reach (beyond Massachusetts) for our Haitian community. Through this initiative we aim to impact a minimum of 20 different businesses, high schools, faith-based and community organizations by providing health education sessions to promote awareness and understanding surrounding the barriers of suboptimal Mental Health and its effects on access and maintenance of self-care. Success of this project had been measured by surveying 136 members of the community. Due to the out poor of positive feedback from the utilization of short film during our 2019 health education tour, HAMA plans to create a short film on Mental Health Awareness within the Haitian community (see attachments).

Discussing his work as a â€œCartooning Chaplainâ€, Kurt Shaffert expressed difficulty in engaging the larger chaplain community with graphic medicine and that an â€œelevator pitchâ€ of sorts would help. In addition, a place to direct those â€œsoldâ€ by the pitch to for further relevant information and suggested reading would solidify outreach efforts at events such as conferences. 
Our project combines this need with the of outreach efforts by the National Library of Medicine 
Exhibit Program (https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/graphicmedicine) and the NNLM NER Graphic Medicine Initiative (https://nnlm.gov/ner/graphic-medicine) to make graphic medicine known and useable by as many people as possible.

26249	9999.0	Diabetes 2020 â€“ A Brief Medication Review Booklet/Menu for Providers and Patients	"This project will expand on work currently underway to create a Diabetes 2020 â€“ Useful Information booklet that is currently being piloted in the primary care setting to update clinicians. The booklet is intended to facilitate more current prescriptive practices surrounding the treatment of diabetes. The booklet was borne from a project to provide a shared decision-making â€œmenuâ€ to assist patients understand treatment of their diabetes. During the research phase, it was discovered prescribers were unfamiliar with the most current ADA algorithm and the newer antidiabetic agents, so a shared decision-making tool was inappropriate. A brief handout was subsequently created for clinician consumption and has been useful for prescribers (MD, ARNP, etc.), clinic nurses and for medical and advanced practice nursing students. The goals of this project are to first complete the current document for clinicians and format into a pocket sized booklet for easy carry; create a patient oriented menu for use by clinicians with patients; secure continuing medical and nursing education credits; and promote and disseminate the booklet and menu at conferences to help prescribers and learners alike become more familiar with the current ADA algorithm and anti-diabetic agents used in the

This project involves an educational webinar (via Zoom) that will present to members of the National Black Nurses Association (NBNA) a list of publicly available National Library of Medicine (NLM) resources that the members can use to learn more about an under-recognized and underdiagnosed, yet fatal, genetic condition that disproportionately affect African Americans (transthyretin-related hereditary cardiac amyloidosis). NBNA members working within and outside of academia have expressed that they want to know more 1) about the importance of African American community engagement in precision medicine, 2) how precision medicine research can address health care disparities, and 3) educational library tools they can use to learn more and educate others about genomics and precision medicine. Thus, we strongly believe that our educational program, along with a program evaluation survey that will be reused from our prior All of Us Research Program engagement, is necessary to help empower the African American nursing community who may not know or be aware of the availability of NLM tools, help them learn more about how precision medicine has or can affect healthcare and health outcomes among the African American population, and further evaluate and determine ways to improve our local chapter education and engagement programs.

The project will include a NLM Traveling Exhibit on Domestic Abuse and a personal safety course offered by local experts.  A self-care fair for female youth and adults that will have different booths that addresses all the aspects of self-care such as skin care, diet, exercise, mental health, support groups, beauty, fashion, hobbies/interests, etc.
26945	15000.0	Chinatown COVID Relief Program	Our project will provide culturally and linguistically appropriate COVID-19 outreach and education to low-income immigrants and refugees in the Chinatown and Lincoln Heights areas of Los Angeles. Low-income immigrants and refugees are among the highest at risk of contracting COVID-19 but the least likely to receive accurate public health information in a timely manner. This is due to a wide range of economic, linguistic, and technological barriers.
26967	20000.0	Health Careers Boot Camp Series: Increasing the Health Professions Pipeline in Californiaâ€™s Central Valley	"The California Health Sciences University (CHSU) Health Sciences Library, in collaboration with the CHSU Simulation Center, Marketing and Communications, and faculty and staff in the College of Osteopathic Medicine (COM) and the College of Pharmacy (COP) strive to educate the next generation of health professionals to serve the people of the state of California, particularly in the Central Valley. We seek to engage high school students from underrepresented populations and in areas of highest need. Our Health Careers Boot Camp series will target first-generation, and economically and educationally disadvantaged high school students in the districts of Fresno and Madera counties, two of the Central Valleyâ€™s seven counties, beginning in the summer 2020 and continuing throughout the award year. To this end, we will offer a series of Health Careers Boot Camps geared towards prospective students and applicants.  Our goal is to spark the interest of prospective students not only in our own programs of osteopathic medicine and pharmacy, but also in collaborating educational institutions offering programs in many health careers such as respiratory therapy, medical assistance, nursing, emergency medical services (EMS), paramedic and infection control.  Active hands on experiences will be demonstrated in inpatient hospital scenario simulations as well as outpatient medical office simulation settings. The Health Careers Boot Camp series will include demonstrations of cutting-edge technology with a focus on simulation-based education, human anatomy, and the biomedical and clinical sciences. In addition, National Library of Medicine (NLM) databases, such as MedlinePlus and PubMed will be highlighted in order to increase awareness of health information resources for aspiring health professionals, and to better integrate the role of libraries in health professions education and training. NLM database presentations and health careers software demonstrations will be led by health sciences librarians, simulation specialists, and anatomy and biomedical sciences faculty.      

High School students with an interest in the health professions, such as medicine, nursing, paramedic/EMS, medical assisting, pharmacy, respiratory therapy, and infection control, as well as faculty, and community health care providers throughout Californiaâ€™s Central Valley, will benefit from enhanced access to high fidelity simulation manikins, realistic patient cases, task trainer equipment, along with access to, and training on how to locate high-quality, evidence-based health information available through the National Library of Medicine (NLM) and other reputable resources. The Express Outreach Award, entitled, Health Careers Boot Camp Series: Increasing the Health Professions Pipeline in Californiaâ€™s Central Valley, will allow the Health Sciences Library to collaborate with the Simulation Center, Marketing and Communications, and faculty from the COM and COP, and to participate in a series of Health Careers Boot Camps, geared towards high school students from Californiaâ€™s Central Valley with an interest in the health professions.   

This Express Outreach Award will support the NLMâ€™s Strategic Plan, to â€œaccelerate discovery and advance health through data-driven researchâ€; and to â€œreach more people in more ways through enhanced dissemination and engagementâ€ (U.S. National Library of Medicine, NLM Board of Regents, 2017).    

The target populations will include economically and educationally disadvantaged high school students residing in Californiaâ€™s Central Valley district, representing two of its seven counties - Fresno and Madera. Groups of up to ten students will be invited to the CHSU campus to participate in a series of half day Boot Camps and to gain hands-on exposure to medical and health sciences career opportunities. The target populations will visit a series of health career stations and receive information about the specific health professions. They will engage with interactive technology and simulators used for education in healthcare and participate in demonstrations of some of the latest technologies. Students will also have opportunities for hands-on practice based on a medical or health sciences career while interacting and being assisted by current medical students at CHSU. 

CHSU has established outreach programs specifically to connect with Californiaâ€™s Central Valley students. Although the focus is to have high school students from underrepresented populations comprise most of the Health Careers Boot Camp participants, students from any demographic background are welcome to attend. The CHSU Marketing and Communications Department will extend invitations to the high school allied health careers program as a first choice. Any high school can choose to open the opportunity up to other students should there be an interest. It would be up to the high school to develop the criteria for student selection. Instructors within these courses can determine which students meet the intention of the program. Parent and instructor consent are required. It would be suggested to the instructors of these courses to request a written essay from students interested in attending and make decisions based on the written content, interest in attending, reason for considering a health career and any research done by the student on medical careers.

26970	11200.0	Improving Health Literacy Awareness with Mobile Technology	The Fraser Resource Center and Health Sciences Library project plan is to use mobile technology to bring health literacy awareness to the community of Hall County.  The goal of this project is to promote health literacy resources and All of Us Research Program with the aid of mobile tablets.  This proposal is requesting funds to purchase mobile devices (tablets) enabling medical librarians to further engage with the Northeast Georgia Health System (NGHS) community through specific outreach initiatives with the Hall County Public Library System.  
26973	19000.0	Healthy and Digital Literacy Train the Trainer Program	"This project will enhance Miami-Dade Public Library Systemâ€™s (MDPLS) ability to provide health literacy information and reference services to the public through the expansion of staff health literacy professional development, a program for trauma-informed service staff training and to purchase the Public Library Associationâ€™s (PLA) customizable Digital Learn online platform offering training for digital literacy and health information. 
MDPLS plans to increase its CHIS Level I specialization recipients in direct support of the Miami-Dade Countyâ€™s health and wellness initiatives and future programming. A Board of County Commissionerâ€™s resolution obliged the MDPLS regional libraries to either create in-house, or through partnership with local health education providers, monthly health information and wellness programs. MDPLS will be opening the Westchester Health and Wellness Information Center in 2021. In collaboration with educators at National Network of Libraries of Medicine Southeastern/Atlantic region (NNLM SEA), the â€œStand Up for Healthâ€ courses will be available for MDPLS and other municipal public library staff to complete the course in addition to participating in several Learning Circles. This funding request also includes a retainer for a Learning Circles facilitator for trauma-informed service or presenter for bibliotherapy training for library staff in the spring of 2021. These professional development courses would increase awareness of the effects of trauma on human behavior, improve customer service, and provide staff with tools to diffuse conflict.
PLA Digital Learn would be branded for MDPLS to be used for virtual and in-person public-facing reference services and programming. The project is in direct support of NNLMâ€™s All of Us outreach program increasing public awareness of and access to quality health information and health literacy education available from NLM and NNLM. Health literacy requires digital literacy skills to access and discover consumer health information using technology. The Digital Learn website merges modules for digital literacy and health literacy, with additional modules in progress. An MDPLS branded Digital Learn link would offer patron access to lessons that include the skills necessary to become savvy consumers of health information, while providing content for staff-led digital literacy programming and would demonstrate project impact through learner analytics. The MDPLS Digital Learn website would advance the NNLM goal to improve public health by providing libraries with the tools necessary to provide health reference and information services, thereby improving patronsâ€™ access to information that enables them to make educated decisions about their health.
MDPLS Digital Learn also provides a platform for asynchronous self-paced lessons to be developed by staff for specific topics relevant to their communities and serves as a resource for virtual. Virtual offerings are especially relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic. Libraries are re-envisioning service models, including virtual and in-person programming and outreach. Library spaces may not be available for traditional use or will need to operate at limited capacity for occupancy and service in order to abide by recommended health and safety standards such as physical distancing. Virtual service delivery is safest to prevent virus exposure and spread. The MDPLS Digital Learn website would create access to tools to safely and expeditiously continue programming supporting digital and health literacies critical for post-pandemic recovery.

26976	19000.0	Promoting Health Through Digital Literacy	The goal of the Clayton County Library System Health Literacy Initiative is to teach library patrons (particularly minority and underserved populations in our community) how to search for and evaluate health information using MedlinePlus.  We will introduce Health Literacy to our patrons using Digital Literacy, and incorporate training on Disaster Health and Clinical Trials.gov to provide information access to our public health and community health professionals throughout the County.   Our goal is to improve awareness to and develop skills in locating high-quality, easy-to-understand health information.  We plan to use a team approach to provide training to staff,  and  public &amp; community health professionals in the county.   This project supports the mission of the NNLM by promoting awareness of and access to evidence based consumer health information for members of an underserved health population, vital disaster preparedness information to health care providers, an introduction to Precision Medicine and an introduction to Medical Research &amp; the benefits of Clinical Trials to our community.   Our program is sustainable as we will partner with local health professionals, who along with out patrons will ultimately develop health literacy skills that will allow them to read and evaluate health related information,  which can then be used to make informed decisions regarding healthcare.  In addition to training, we will partner with the Clayton Health District (CAN) Community Health Network, All of Us Emory, All of Us Morehouse School of Medicine and the Hispanic Health Coalition of Ga to promote and recruit for All of US.  
26996	13980.0	Expanding Telehealth Services at WCCHC School-Based Health Clinics	Telehealth is rapidly emerging as the standard of care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Telehealth not only offers a safer alternative to in-person services for both patients and providers, but also reduces barrier to access of appropriate medical, behavioral health, and health education services, particularly in low income, rural areas. Many of the youth in the communities served by WCCHC cannot sufficiently access telehealth services for a variety of reasons. Expanding the ability to offer telehealth services at our school-based clinics will ensure youth have a safe, confidential location to meet with a medical provider, behavioral health provider, and/or health educator that sufficiently has the technology to execute quality care on school grounds. As it stands, our school-based health clinics lack some of the crucial resources needed to appropriately facilitate telehealth services. This is in large part due to the rapid and unexpected closure of the school-based clinics at the start of the pandemic. If approved for these grant funds, our clinic will be able to rapidly acquire necessary resources to accommodate telehealth services. We are requesting funds for a one-time technology improvement to assist with the acquisition of necessary computer workstations to execute telehealth services for underserved youth at rural Hawaii school-based health clinics.
26999	19794.0	CDU and King/Drew High School Health Professionals Partnership	The proposed project seeks to create an awareness of how to find and evaluate reliable health information on the Internet. The target population are students who are enrolled at King/Drew High School in one of the certification programs. A major concern is students are unsure as to where to find reliable health information, hence the need for library workshops. The primary emphasis of the library workshops will be to introduce students to reliable health information available from the National Library of Medicine and it affilates. Over the course of the project, students will demonstrate how to find, evaluate, and use  reliable health information on the Internet.
27051	2500.0	Southwest Missouri Community Health Literacy Project	CoxHealth Library Services will collaborate with Springfield-Greene County Library District (SGCL) to provide interactive online consumer health education. SGCL will host a page on the SGCL website dedicated to health information and literacy. The Health Information Page will display links to grant fund created modules and, as deemed appropriate, additional resources will be added to the page with a primary focus on including content from NLM. The partnership between CoxHealth and SGCL represents an innovative collaboration that will improve health literacy in the Greene County, Missouri community.
27064	4200.0	Beaumont Library District Health Outreach Initiative 	Our plan is to use the funds to acquire books on Covid-19, which we will use in a display in order to educate the public on the topic. We also plan using up to ten Kindle Paperwhites to loan out to our patrons so as to better advertise our e-book services.
27067	20000.0	Mobile Hotspots for Circulation	Through this proposed project, the Nevada County Community Library will purchase 47 mobile hotspots and lend them to library cardholders for at-home use. Borrowers will also receive information about authoritative online health resources, such as PubMed, MedlinePlus, ClinicalTrials.gov, free NNLM online classes, the All of Us Research Program and Nevada Countyâ€™s Public Health website. This project will help to bridge the digital divide experienced by Nevada County residents who cannot afford traditional internet access at home or for whom home internet service is simply not available, thereby contributing to equal access to health information.
27212	20000.0	Promoting Mammograms for LGBT Community Members in Pennsylvania Through Public Library Outreach	Surveys consistently show that rates of mammography are significantly lower among lesbian and bisexual people than their heterosexual counterparts, according to the National LGBT Cancer Network. Bradbury-Sullivan LGBT Community Center acknowledges a variety of unique challenges for the LGBT community that may cause this health disparity, and the 2018 Pennsylvania LGBT Health Needs Assessment identifies a few major obstacles: nearly 57% of respondents report fearing a negative reaction from their health care providers regarding their LGBT identity, and more than one-third find their clinicians only slightly or not at all knowledgeable about crucial LGBT-specific health concerns. This lack of inclusivity prevents LGBT people from receiving fundamental healthcare, like routine mammograms and screening conversations. Additionally, the lack of LGBT-specific knowledge leaves community members unaware and misinformed, even by their own providers, about their increased need for regular screenings. Higher rates of tobacco use, alcohol abuse, obesity, and nulliparity put LGBT people assigned female at birth at higher risk of breast cancer, yet they receive fewer screenings than cisgender heterosexual women. Bradbury-Sullivan LGBT Community Center recognizes this issue in our own community, and there could not be a better time to promote breast cancer screenings to our community members. These critical preventative screenings can save lives - but only if patients know to receive them. Bradbury-Sullivan LGBT Community Center has significant expertise and a proven record of providing health promotion to the LGBT population in Pennsylvania. In 2019, Bradbury-Sullivan LGBT Community Center received the Breast Cancer Community Partnership Award from the Pennsylvania Commission on Women. We have administered similar projects related to cervical and anal Pap tests, HIV testing, and tobacco cessation. Our organization is well-situated and ready to educate our community on the need and availability of mammograms from LGBT-welcoming providers and we will partner with public libraries in four counties in Eastern Pennsylvania to conduct virtual health promotion to encourage mammograms for LGBT community members.
27241	19994.0	BGHF Minds Matter- Harrisburg	Black Girl Health Foundationâ€™s â€œMinds Matter Harrisburgâ€ is a program in partnership with The Dauphin County Library System that is designed to reach out to women of color in the Harrisburg, Pennsylvania area and educate them about mental health and mental health resources. Black Girl Health Foundation (BGHF) has already hosted a very successful in-person iteration of Minds Matter in Harrrisburg, PA with the support of the Dauphin County Library System, and we have Minds Matter - NOLA scheduled to take place October 10th, 2020 in New Orleans, Louisiana. In the wake of the COVID-19 Pandemic; a lack of certainty about the end or extension of quarantining and social distancing requirements; and civil unrest, offering digital mental health literacy couldnâ€™t be more timely and crucial. BGHF is prepared to transition Minds Matter into a series of digital workshops; a video/streaming event will air live on social media via a special Black Girl Health (BGH) â€˜Minds Matter Harrisburgâ€™ Facebook Group, and a recorded version will be hosted on The Dauphin County Library System of Pennsylvania&#039;s website. Both the BGHF College Ambassador and workshop participants will learn how the NLM resource â€œMedlinePlusâ€ is a powerful tool for learning about and managing mental health. While the campaign and workshops increase access to mental health information, the evaluations obtained at the close of workshops may provide valuable biomedical information pertaining to the mental health beliefs and concerns of a historically underserved demographic.
27244	16500.0	Mental Health Resources in Oil Creek District	The Oil Creek Library District will be providing a digital repository of mental health resources for the fourteen library outlets in our District (Clarion, Jefferson, and Venango counties in PA). In addition to the digital books and audiobooks, the District will be facilitating virtual programming with local health providers on topics regarding mental health. The programming will have both a recorded, archived access and a live Q&amp;A session that will not be recorded. Finally, the District will be creating virtual tutorials for accessing our available health resources.
27251	10438.0	Connect for your health	Connect for your health is a partnership between Hershey Public Library and the Penn State Health Milton S. Hershey Medical Center to bring consumer health resources to those in our community who fall between the cracks of the digital divide. A series of virtual workshops will introduce attendees to the wealth of resources available online and in their community to support their health and wellness. This program will be targeted to those in our community who do not have in-home internet access. Attendees will be provided with a laptop and internet hot spot in order to attend. Workshops will cover evaluating online health information, health information in the news, and an introduction to MedLine Plus. 
27373	5889.0	Ending the Stigma - A Mental Health Series - #2	Lindenwood University will bring a mental health speaker to campus to challenge the mental health stigma and supply students with information and resources that are available to them. The Project will hold a hybrid speaker event (in person and/or Zoom); hold four educational objective programs to promote mental health resources and the continuing discussion of mental health; create a mental health resource center in Lindenwood University&#039;s library. The mental health resource center will contain  books, brochures, handouts, and other resources students can take to help with any mental health concern.
27376	1850.0	Staying Healthy At Home Cooking Club Pilot	The project will provide equipment to participate in weekly virtual lessons on nutrition and using MedlinePlus.gov as the primary resource for reputable health information. The project focuses on increasing the practical knowledge of culinary skills and nutrition needed to promote positive behavior change related to selecting foods to feed a family.
27403	2500.0	Fitness Fridays	The project will provide learning opportunities for the Goddard community on the topics of gardening, the importance of mental health, healthy eating, and healthy living. The Project will schedule  monthly programs for the community. Offerings will include but not be limited to blood pressure checks, yoga classes for all ages, healthy eating meal preparation for the week, massage, chiropractic information,  gardening, self-care, exercise, StoryWalks on local trails and at local parks to promote movement and more. The Library wants to educate the community on healthy ways of living and the options available locally and statewide for all ages. The aim is to increase health, information and reading literacy within one program. 
27410	15070.0	Central PA FUN (Food: Understanding Nutrition) Initiative 	"The Central PA FUN (Food: Understanding Nutrition) Initiative will be focused on improving health literacy around food &amp; nutrition in six counties in central Pennsylvania. Based on a partnership between the District Library Centers in Altoona and Johnstown, this project would serve residents of Indiana, Cambria, Somerset, Blair, Bedford &amp; Huntingdon Counties. The Initiative has two main areas of focus: improving access to quality cooking &amp; nutrition information &amp; resources; and increasing family nutrition literacy. 
To improve library collections we will invest in quality physical and electronic resources around health, food and nutrition; improve linkages between library websites and resources like MedLine Plus; provide information about programs like All Of Us and SciStarters to libraries &amp; library users; and finally provide training on all these resources to library staff members so that they are prepared to assist the public. 
To improve family nutrition literacy, we will create a book club program for families to get more resources &amp; skills around food and nutrition. It will be a hybrid phone/electronic book club where families sign up and get physical books &amp; cookbooks and attend discussions via phone or internet to hear a speaker &amp; discuss their experience with cooking healthy food as a family. To improve the diversity of our audience, we will diversify our advertising efforts to ensure that families without an internet connection hear about the program. All components of the program will be accessible without an internet connection.

27413	20000.0	Multicultural Conversations About the End of Life 	High-quality end of life care should be available to all individuals in a timely manner, and in alignment with their values, wishes, and goals. Unfortunately, the reality of end of life care in the United States is quite different, with the healthcare system often failing to meet the needs of certain communities. One particular community, immigrant families, encounter particular disparities in quality of, and access to, end of life care. As the current healthcare system in the United States often frames dying from a Euro/Western-centric perspective, this may not reflect what an immigrant family may need in the areas of communication, decision making, comfort, community, identity, and grief. When these experiences and values are at odds, this poses conflict for the patient, their family, and the healthcare team at a time of great vulnerability. Therefore, it is imperative to address this continued inequity through access to relevant end of life resources and culturally congruent end of life care.  The goal of this program is to provide much-needed support and information to adult children of immigrants, who face the unique challenge of helping their aging parents navigate a complicated medical system.  The webinars will provide an overview of the American medical system (including palliative care, hospice, and advance directives) and information on how immigrant children can support their parents as they navigate this landscape and articulate their values and wishes about end of life based on their culture, traditions, and experiences.  Program attendees will learn about treatment options and gain actionable skills to approach these difficult conversations and moments. Through this program, we hope for attendees to feel more empowered in caring for their loved ones at a deeply vulnerable time. Through this programming, the elderly immigrant population, of New York and their families be offered a program leading to increased understanding and access to end of life issues, including local laws, advance directives, hospice, and palliative care.
27514	49500.0	#BlackLivesMatter: Community Health All-Night	Queens Borough Public Library (also known as â€œQueens Public Libraryâ€ or â€œQPLâ€), in collaboration with the Black Caucus of the American Library Association (â€œBCALAâ€), will conduct a 24-hour virtual event that will provide health information that is accessible, necessary, and interesting to the African American community in Queens and nationwide. Medical experts will share information on health topics that are relevant to members of the Black community in every stage of life. Health topics would include COVID-19, mental health, common chronic illnesses, healthy relationships, and ways to keep family members healthy. In the overnight hours of the event, we will examine health issues like insomnia and enjoy programming on topics like yoga nidra, before participants wake up to sun salutations. Health topics will focus on action steps that can be taken to improve health and will be integrated with an array of physical activity, entertainment (e.g., author talks, Happy Hour Healthy Mixology, and DJ sets), and discussions to guide young people of color toward careers in healthcare and librarianship. We will also create programming specifically discussing the All of Us Research Program and Medline Plus, such as a program on the lack of diversity in medical research.
27640	5000.0	MAC/MLA 2020 Annual Conference	The MAC/MLA 2020 Annual Conference will bring together members of the Mid-Atlantic Chapter of the Medical Library association for a virtual meeting. Members of MAC/MLA include librarians and information professionals who fill a number of roles and work in a variety of settings including hospitals, academic medical centers, consumer health libraries, and research and association libraries. This event will provide a number of professional development opportunities including networking events and continuing education classes. Additionally, attendees will present posters, papers, and lightning talks, and two keynote speakers will address algorithmic bias and corrections to the scientific record.
27648	12000.0	Kadlec Community Resource Desk	The Kadlec Community Resource Desk (KCRD) assists individuals and families who are in need of support to get connected to resources in their community, specifically as it relates to Social Determinants of Health.  This free and confidential service is open to everyone.  There will be two Kadlec Community Resource Desks, the primary desk will be located within the Kadlec Neurological Resource Center (KNRC) Library within the Kadlec Healthplex.  When hospital visitor restrictions are lifted due to COVID19, we will add a second KCRD location at Kadlec Hospital.  In collaboration with the existing Kadlec Neurological Resource Center Library, anyone seeking assistance with resources will also have access to support groups and educational programs.  When necessary, especially during strict social distancing guidelines such as COVID19 &quot;Stay Home&quot; guidelines, these resources will be available by phone, virtually through an online video platform and on the Kadlec website.  KNRC Library is under the umbrella of Kadlec&#039;s Community Health department.  The KCRD project is a joint effort between the Community Health (CH) Department, Providence St. Joseph Health Community Health Investment (CHI), and Kadlec&#039;s Ambulatory Care Management (ACM) team.  A benefit of this collaboration is that ACM employees who are staffing the KCRD at Kadlec Regional Medical Center (KRMC) are bilingual in Spanish/English.  The CH and CHI team members and the ACM team members will be able to collaborate to provide the best information available to those served by the KCRD library.  
27653	12000.0	Bridging the Gap: Ensuring Digital Equity through WiFi Hotspot Lending 	"Since colleges and universities across the country moved to emergency remote learning for the spring 2020 semester, it has become abundantly clear there is a very real digital divide among students (and families) who have access to a home computer and/or reliable, high-speed Internet and those that do not. With many classes again being offered through online modalities for the Fall 2020, and social distancing guidelines limiting computer lab space, this divide will continue to inhibit students&#039; abilities to easily complete their course work.

To ease the digital divide and improve studentsâ€™ academic success, Montana State University (MSU) Library requests funding for four Wi-Fi hotspots and data plans to increase access to the Internet for those students most in need. The Wi-Fi hotspots will be loaned to students on medium- to long-term check-outs to enable them access their course content either as on-campus or online students. The hotspots will be offered through an application process to identify students with high-need and marketed to programs on campus that already work closely with underrepresented students."
27656	5000.0	Action Health Partners Website ImprovementÂ 	Action Health Partners (AHP) is a non-profit organization dedicated to educating, supporting and empowering individuals to improve their quality of life and well-being in North Central Washington (NCW) â€“ a four county region located in central Washington. This project will allow for AHP to redesign and update their website for NCW residents to be better connected with AHP services that provide information on how to make more informed decisions about their health. Due to the vast rural geographic area served and the COVID-19 pandemic, now more than ever it is important for AHP to have an updated website to provide greater information on and access to AHP services and to better engage and build relationships with NCW residents.

27724	106824.0	NNLM Wash & Learn National Model (Year 2)	"Through various partnerships with local libraries and national organizations, including the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) and the National Network of Libraries of
Medicine (NNLM), Libraries Without Borders (LWB) has rapidly scaled its Wash and Learn Initiative (WALI), which delivers library services and programs in laundromats. Beginning as an
early childhood literacy program, WALI has broadened its scope to include critical health information, digital literacy, and to raise awareness about the All of Us Research Program (All of Us) among laundromat customers across 4 locations in the Middle Atlantic (MAR) and Greater Midwest (GMR) regions of the NNLM through its WALI-Health program. With the infrastructure
for WALI and WALI-Health in place, LWB is in a unique position to expand on this model at a national level.

Phase 2 seeks to expand WALI-Health by increasing the capacity of libraries, small business owners, and community partners to develop tailored outreach projects that reach low-income
populations, many of which are underrepresented in biomedical research communities. In Phase 2, LWB will build on the toolkitâ€™s content based on feedback from members of the
Advisory Committee and other partners received in phase 1. LWB will produce a singular, cost effective national model that can be easily leveraged by individual libraries and customized to
the needs of their community. This will reduce the burden on libraries on developing a WALI Health site from scratch, allowing them to use the strategies and proposals that have been
successful in the past. This phase 2 of the project integrates the existing work of NNLM grantees, kiosk learning programs, and library-health outreach. By continuing the development
of the WALI Health model through April 30, 2021 to final completion, LWB and its partners have the unique ability to develop quality end products that will enable libraries and small business
owners across the country to deliver WALI-Health sites."
27739	138330.0	The San Francisco Bay Areaâ€™s Response to the AIDS Epidemic: Digitizing and  Providing Universal Access to Historical AIDS Records	"The Archives and Special Collections (Archives) department of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Library, seeks a support from the NNLM to digitize approximately 43,000-45,000 pages from 15 archival collections related to the early days of the AIDS epidemic in the San Francisco Bay Area and make them widely accessible to the public on the Internet. 
This new digital collection will address the gaps that exist in relation to materials chronicling the experience and struggles of communities of color and marginalized communities in the early days of the AIDS epidemic.  
This project will make publicly accessible experiences of communities that are â€œabsent or excluded from the history of HIV/AIDS in the United Statesâ€ [Jennifer Brier, â€¯The Oral History Review, Volume 45, Issue 1]. Its goal is to include the voices of underrepresented and marginalized groups in the historical record and increase public impact of these archival collections.

27825	9900.0	Health Literacy in Action for Opioid Misuse	Opioid prescriptions and lack of awareness and information fuel the opioid epidemic, leading to the increased risk for potential of opioid misuse and addiction. This project will bring opioid awareness information and public health information seeking skills to older adults, Hispanic community, educators, health providers and the public. During our planned opioid education sessions, attendees will hear a presentation by an opioid education professional; be provided easy to read take home materials and be introduced to NLM electronic health information products. Our primary opioid misuse focus is â€œthe best prevention option is through education and awarenessâ€.
27841	36751.0	Innovate to Communicate: Health Literacy Workforce Development	"Innovate to Communicate: Health Literacy Workforce Development aims to educate frontline clinicians and hospital leaders in the knowledge and application of health literacy practices. By equipping clinicians and leaders with the tools and resources they need to take action, Innovate to Communicate will promote the health literate organization in North Texas hospitals. Innovate to Communicate will include self-learning modules and an in person, multimedia, interactive workshop using videos, story-telling, discussion, and simulation with Standardized Patient actors to encourage not only learning but more importantly attitudinal and behavioral change towards a health literate organization. Interactive quizzes that test knowledge, attitudes, and application as well as the incorporation of communication observation tools of clinician-patient interactions during simulations will reinforce health literacy practices. Specifically, our project team, in collaboration with clinicians, leaders, and educators, will build the Innovate to Communicate modules and workshop to teach clinicians and leaders how to: 1) communicate using evidence based health literacy practices e.g. plain language, chunking information, teach back; 2) focus attention and ways to integrate health literacy into structures, processes, and quality measures;
and 3) effectively use health literacy resources to promote a health literate organization. To meet clinicians and leaders where they are, we will partner with the DFW Hospital Council Foundation (DFWHCF) and area hospitals. Our project team will use a train the trainer model to build sustainability, training identified persons to become health literacy advocates, who will in turn offer Innovate to Communicate to other clinicians and leaders in their hospitals."

27931	4201.0	Playtime Yoga Time	The Playtime Yoga Time program will be presented weekly from September 2020 through April 2021 (less three holiday weeks) and will be aimed toward children ages 3-8 (though appropriate for any age). By creating a weekly series of classes children will develop a healthy habit of improving the body and mind. Based in the classical study of yoga, the Playoga classes use tools and activities to help children focus their minds and bodies all while having fun. Each class includes a question of the day to end the class. Storytime Yoga Classes consist of the reading of one picture book, a yoga flow that follows the book&#039;s storyline, and a closing meditation. According to an article by Marlynn Wei, M.D., J.D. &quot;Yoga and mindfulness have been shown to improve both physical and mental health in school-age children (ages 6 to 12). Yoga improves balance, strength, endurance, and aerobic capacity in children. Yoga and mindfulness offer psychological benefits for children as well. A growing body of research has already shown that yoga can improve focus, memory, self-esteem, academic performance, and classroom behavior, and can even reduce anxiety and stress in children&quot; (Harvard Health Publishing).

28059	10000.0	Radical Self-Care and Wellness for Information Professionals	"Audre Lorde states, â€œCaring for myself is not self-indulgence; it is self-preservation and that is an act of political warfareâ€.1 For librarians of color, the stresses of working and existing in the predominantly white spaces of libraries and librarianship, can be both physically and mentally exhausting.2 Currently, librarians of color are experiencing the impact of stress from ongoing systematic racism against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic. Stress from this global pandemic is disproportionately impacting communities of color in the United States. Librarians who come from these communities are more likely to know people affected by COVID-19.3 This double pandemic of systematic racism and COVID-19 is best addressed with deliberate action. As such, members of the African American Medical Librarians Alliance (AAMLA) Caucus aim to create a webinar series titled, Radical Self-Care and Wellness for Information Professionals.

The purpose of this wellness initiative is to help combat barriers often faced by communities of color including disparities in access to mental health and wellness resources, as well as stigma against receiving care. The importance of having wellness and radical self care/therapy resources readily available to Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) helps to mitigate the impact of these added stressors. By providing a virtual wellness series, we will help to reduce the aforementioned barriers and in turn support the health and well being of our intended audience."
28243	138805.5	AgriSafeHealthHub (AHH)	The purpose of the NLM funded project is to create an agricultural health and information hub that serves as a clearinghouse for public health information for farmers, ranchers, farmworkers and rural health professionals. Titled AgriSafeHealthHub (AHH), it will align with NLM best practices by supporting the information needs of rural health professionals and agricultural communities across the nation. The proposed AHH is an innovation that will become a signature program accessible through the AgriSafe website. It will integrate and organize various learning platforms under one â€œhubâ€ to aid in the user experience. For example, the AgriSafe Learning Lab, MedlinePlus, and PubMed will be available for access, organized by agricultural health risk. AHH is intended to introduce the user to reliable health information that matches the occupational risk of the farmer through an algorithm-based approach. Active promotion of health information from AHH to the user will include monthly newsletters, eight submissions to Bringing Health Information to the Community Blog, monthly media releases on NLM, video stories from the field and AgriSafe health informatics that match National Health Observances, promotion of NLM training events, NIOSH agricultural health center trainings, NPOs trainings and AgriSafe trainings. AgriSafe seeks the technical assistance of NNLM South Central Region -specific promotion and training into the development of AHH.
28249	45000.0	Pop The Question - Men Take The Wheel	&quot;Pop the Question - Men Take The Wheelâ€ is an expansion of Black Girl Healthâ€™s (BGH) 4-year national HIV/AIDS prevention campaign. This two (2) month digital campaign features a social influencer video and infographics that convey important messaging through entertainment, comedy, and a conversational tone to promote PrEP/PEP and empower Black men to feel more comfortable &quot;popping the questionâ€ of getting tested to their partner. The innovative thing about this iteration of Pop The Question is that it will target African American men â€” empowering them to â€˜take the wheelâ€™ and lead the conversation about sexual health within the Black community. This is of particular importance, because data indicates Black Americans may be disproportionately impacted by HIV/AIDS in part because African American men engage in high-risk sexual behavior by having unprotected sex with both men and women. Pop The Question - Men Take The Wheel will encourage an open dialogue amongst Black men that addresses the struggles, fears, and stigmas behind popping the question; how to make â€œpopping the questionâ€ more comfortable; and educating African Americans about PrEP and PEP. 
28329	17650.0	Bioinformatics and Data Science Support for Regional Medical Libraries: a Needs Assessment and Webinar	Despite the fast-changing landscapes of teaching, research and patient care, libraries remain trusted repositories of knowledge that clinicians and scholars access and rely on especially in the electronic era. Libraries are key partners and help patrons find, interpret, manage and produce knowledge and increasingly libraries also provide support for non-traditional services like data analysis, a key component of research and publication in todayâ€™s world of big data. This is particularly true for biomedical sciences and, at the Cushing/Whitney Medical Library, we have found that there is an immense need and appreciation by clinicians and scientists for the bioinformatics data analysis support and computational data research skills that we provide. Here, we propose multiple ways in which we seek to share our knowledge of providing data analysis support at a medical library with our peers at other libraries and regional health sciences centers. Overarching project goals include (1) perform a needs assessment to determine the current state of bioinformatics services offered through academic and hospital libraries in the NE region, and (2) develop and offer a webinar that will offer an overview of national bioinformatics programs in libraries and initiate a conversation about establishing bioinformatics and data programs within libraries in the region. More detailed project goals and deliverables can be found under â€œProject Goals and Objectives.â€
28335	25634.0	High-Performance Scanner for Medical Historical Library Digitization Program	"We seek to purchase a high-performance scanner to make available the rich collections of the Medical Historical Library at the Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library, Yale University. The Library holds one of the countryâ€™s largest collections of rare medical books, journals, prints, photographs, pamphlets, and a growing archives program. Special strengths are the works of Hippocrates, Galen, Vesalius, Boyle, Harvey, Culpeper, Haller, Priestley, and S. Weir Mitchell, and works on anatomy, anesthesia, and smallpox inoculation and vaccination. The Library owns over fifty medieval and renaissance manuscripts dating back to the 12th century, Arabic and Persian manuscripts, and over 300 medical incunabula.  The Clements C. Fry Collection of Prints and Drawings has over 2,500 fine prints, drawings, and posters with themes that include social justice, war, drug use, reproductive rights, HIV/AIDS, activism, and more.  We also have manuscript and archival collections, most notably the Peter Parker Collection, papers of Harvey Cushing, and co-discoverer of Lyme disease Stephen Malawista, virologist G.D. Edith Hsiung, and the Connecticut State Medical Society archives, among others. The Library owns an extensive smoking and tobacco advertising collection, the Robert Bogdan collection of disability photographs and postcards, medical imagery from popular publications donated by Bert Hansen, and smaller collections of patent medicine ephemera from noted collector William Helfand.  The Library also recently acquired one of the largest medical photography collections in the world, the Stanley B. Burns, MD Historic Medical Photography Collection, which contains over 15,000 extraordinary nineteenth and early twentieth century images.

The Medical Historical Library has committed, for well over a decade, to making thousands of items and hundreds of thousands of pages freely and openly available online in various platforms. These images are widely used and are important to a broad demographic including scholars, researchers and students interested in the history of science and medicine and the many topical areas that we specialize in. For example, we have contributed 6,375 scanned books to the Internet Archive that have been viewed over 3.5 million times, and this is just one repository. The proposed scanner purchase would directly support NNLM&#039;s goal to develop, promote, and improve electronic access to health information by Network members, health professionals, and organizations providing health information to the public."
28340	6908.0	Expanding virtual patient education and access to community resources in the nationâ€™s most rural state. 	Maine is the most rural state in the country. This can mean long travel times to reach medical appointments and to access community resources that can help patients manage acute and chronic conditions and improve social determinants of health. COVID-19 has created unprecedented challenges as medical appointments are reduced and local public services and businesses continue with decreased hours and other restrictions. Although libraries play critical roles in Maineâ€™s rural towns, they tend to be small and lack comprehensive health sections. The proposed project is two-fold but has one goal: to increase access to underutilized free resources, bringing library and health resources into the homes of Mainers, with a specific focus on rural and medically underserved areas. The project will create two brief videos: for the public, a video explaining how to access available health education and empowerment information via books (print, audio and e-books) and online chat with a health educator; and for providers, a video outlining the use and benefits of the cloud-based platform Thinkific for offering virtual patient education classes and class material online â€“ and featuring physician peers who are currently using the platform successfully. 
28343	8782.0	Help With Managing COVID-19 Related Stress	For the proposed project, the North Haven Memorial Library (NHML), working with North Haven&#039;s Long Term Recovery Planning Committee and local health and wellness agencies, will promote health literacy and increased awareness of National Library of Medicine resources relating to managing stress and anxiety resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. This will be a two-part project.  First, we will present a speaker series to address mental health and stress in the North Haven community related to COVID-19, partnering with local health and wellness agencies and universities. Second, we are requesting funding for a smart board to enable virtual promotion of trustworthy health resources.  We will partner with the New England Region of the National Library of Medicine to train our local health and wellness partners on the National Library of Medicine resources.  The local health and wellness partners will use the smart board to record short video tutorials on accessing local and reliable NLM resources geared toward their specific populations.  These recordings will be shared with the community via multiple platforms including on the NHML website, social media, and on the local television station, NHTV.

28824	9933.0	An assessment of data stewardship in the Health Sciences Colleges at the University of Iowa	University of Iowa researchers in the Health Sciences Colleges conduct significant research across many domains. In partnership with the Data Services Librarian, Library liaisons in the Hardin Library for the Health Sciences have begun to incorporate research data management support into their service portfolios.  However, the Libraries do not have a detailed picture of the data sharing practices, infrastructure needs, or data literacy of these researchers. An assessment will enable us to more efficiently target instruction, curation, and data preservation and access services, increasing the impact of research through more effective data stewardship and sharing. We are proposing to conduct a needs assessment and education/awareness outreach project. This project will enhance awareness of university support, align services to address gaps and opportunities, and broaden the impact of UI research by improving data sharing practices to be more consistent with FAIR data principles.

29108	15000.0	One Health COVID-19 education for pet owners in marginalized communities	The University of Washington (UW) Health Sciences Library will partner with the UW Center for One Health Research to provide COVID-19 health information outreach to marginalized communities focused on caring for pets and companion animals during the global pandemic. Outreach initiatives will focus on two underserved populations: homeless and non-English speaking communities. Research has shown that pets in households of COVID patients may become infected with SARS CoV2. Marginalized communities including individuals experiencing homelessness and ethnic minorities are at increased risk of contracting COVID-19 and have less access to education surrounding their own COVID risks and the risk to their pets, due to language and cultural barriers and the lack of appropriate educational materials. Additionally, this community is less likely to access veterinary care due to prohibitive costs, language barriers, and transportation issues. To fill that health information gap, the project will and disseminate them to communities in the Pacific Northwest. The project will identify and assemble educational materials about these subjects, adapt currently existing English-only health information resources focused on pet care during COVID-19 into other languages, and use a peer education model to distribute these materials in underserved communities in the Pacific Northwest and beyond.
29294	3663.0	Planning Grant for the Utah Health Literacy Coalition	"This project supports the further development of the Utah Health Literacy Coalition in its mission to improve access to health information, especially for underserved communities, in Utah. It will do so by convening a group of selected subject matter experts and stakeholders to participate in a professionally facilitated planning workshop to establish short, medium, and long-term goals. The primary product of the workshop will be a strategic plan to guide the furtherance and sustainability of the organization.
 
Background: 
The Utah Health Literacy Coalition (UTHLC) was formed to meet a recognized need to expand the influence of Utah-based health information practitioners and to further the cause of health literacy. The group has grown into an affiliation of health educators, public health officials, community health workers, librarians and other interested professionals who are dedicated to improving health for all Utahns through the provision of understandable, accurate, and useful health information in various health information and health delivery contexts. UTHLC currently has approximately 20 members. UTHLC promotes health literacy through the expansion of professional knowledge, which encourages best practices in health communication, including meeting health consumers where they are with respect to their ability to listen to, read, and comprehend health information. UTHLC pursues these goals through educational programs, share groups, library lending arrangements, and outreach. Most of the group&#039;s activities to date have involved the sharing of best practices and programming ideas which have been implemented in their respective organizations. The group has recognized a need to expand its role in Utah&#039;s health literacy and increase its influence. It wishes to pursue its objectives through formalizing its institutional relationships and building capabilities and capacities to further the cause of health literacy among Utah citizens. These capability and capacity objectives will be met through the expansion of programming and services and are intended to align public libraries with knowledge and resources available through medical libraries and public and private health organizations. 
Earlier this year, UTHLC and the Network of the National Library of Medicine MidContinental Region (NNLM MCR) had planned to deliver a Medical Library Association (MLA) Certified Health Information Specialization (CHIS) level 1 all-day preconference workshop, Stand Up for Health: Health and Wellness Services for your Community, at the Utah Library Association&#039;s (ULA) annual conference, on May 13, 2020, in St. George, Utah. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the conference and the workshop were cancelled. That workshop was a conscious part of UTHLC&#039;s objective to train more librarians throughout Utah. An unintended positive consequence of the pandemic resulted in many Utah librarians receiving the CHIS training via multiple online trainings offered by the NNLM during the Spring and Summer months of 2020. UTHLC had an initial goal of training 20 to 30 public librarians in Utah to support the delivery of quality health information via their public library systems and to connect health resources across communities. We have requested an update to the current roster of MLA certified individuals in Utah and hope to soon update Appendix A: Summary of Consumer Health Specialization Certifications in Utah as of January 2, 2020 with the new information. UTHLC has recognized a longer-term need to adopt sustainable organizational structures and practices in order to better aid the delivery of reliable health information. We recognize that CHIS training is a critical baseline component towards building the plan to be executed in the planning workshop that is proposed in this application. 

The objectives of the project outlined in this proposal align with goals of the NNLM and the NNLM All of Us Community Engagement Network. Specifically, the results of the planning meeting will enhance library staff knowledge of health information, especially as it relates to health literacy; coordinate and support community engagement and programming activities in the MCR, including activities to raise awareness of All of Us; foster partnerships involving libraries and organizations interested in health information, including other NNLM members; and leverage public libraries as community conveners where the public can find help locating health information, meeting spaces and access to technology.

29476	7096.0	Moving with Awareness for Better Balance and Fitness	"The Library will offer a series of weekly online movement classes for adults that emphasize the role of the brain in improving balance and strength. Theseclasses will incorporate principles from the Feldenkrais Method of Awareness through Movement, an established form of neuromuscular reeducation that utilizes the brainâ€™s ability to form new neural pathways at any age. Participants are guided to pay close attention to novel but gentle movements that allow the nervous system to learn to reorganize their movements for greater ease and efficiency and to achieve better kinesthetic awareness and balance. Each class involves different movement sequences so that participants continue to experience new neural learning designed to help them better respond
to everyday balance and strength challenges, and to remain physically active in general. A study of the Feldenkrais Method published in Gerontology &amp; Geriatric Medicine found that it was helpful in improving balance and mobility in older adults (Palmer, 2017)."

In 2020, â€œThe Superwoman Projectâ€ was developed as a pilot which was launched in Houston, TXâ€”a city that has struggled badly with mitigating its Coronavirus cases. This pilot program included a series of â€˜Stay Super Guidesâ€™, aka â€˜Superwoman Guidebooksâ€™; these guides provide mothers of color with up-to-date medically sound information related to the COVD-19 Pandemic, and the tools and resources they need to counteract the biggest byproduct of being a mom in the time of Coronavirus: â€˜Superwoman Syndromeâ€™. Now, we hope to take our work one step further. Funding from NNLM-SEA will allow BGHF to expand â€œThe Superwoman Projectâ€ by hosting a live stream virtual workshop series. This event is an opportunity for African American mothers in North Carolinaâ€™s major metropolitan areas of Charlotte and Raleigh to learn how to manage the added stresses of being a â€˜Superwomanâ€™ in an age of fear, loss, and uncertainty. Mothers will also gain access to trusted resources that will point them to regularly updated, science-backed information about protocols, changes, and new developments amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic. This campaign will:

- Improve health information access for patients, patrons, and the public, relating to COVID-19 / SARS-CoV-2.
- Provide access to health information in a way that is meaningful to the target population.
- Increase awareness and utilization of NIH, NLM, and CDC as authoritative resources on COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2.

29594	15000.0	WVSOM Healthy Behavior Outreach Program	"According to the West Virginia Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, West Virginia ranked 1st in the nation, for the prevalence of poor physical health, poor mental health, and activity limitations due to poor physical or mental health.  West Virginia is also 1st in the nation in the occurrence of obesity and cardiovascular disease.  West Virginia ranks 2nd highest nationally in the incidence of diabetes.  When considering healthcare, West Virginia ranks first or second in poor health care.      
West Virginia has the highest age-adjusted rate of drug overdose deaths involving opioids in the country.  According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) in 2017, there were 833 drug overdose deaths involving opioids in West Virginia, a rate of 49.6 deaths per 100,000 persons.  
The mission of the West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine (WVSOM) is the educate students from diverse backgrounds as lifelong learners in osteopathic medicine and complementary health related programs; to support and develop graduate medical education training; to advance scientific knowledge through academic, clinical and basic science research; and to promote patient-centered, evidence based medicine.  WVSOM is dedicated to serve, first and foremost, the state of West Virginia and the health care needs of its residents, emphasizing primary care in rural areas.  WVSOM accomplishes these goals both through education of future physicians and through outreach programs to educate the community.  Educating the community about healthy lifestyles and drug abuse has proven to increase awareness of these community concerns. Our goal is to provide education to 4th-grade students (ages 9-10) and their teachers on one or more of the following topics: opioids, growing vegetables, the benefits of drinking more water, having a balanced food plate, and/or the benefits of eating more vegetables. We will highlight some of the National Library of Medicine websites including MedlinePlus and also use programs provided by the West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine.
Our objective is to provide a virtual program for all 4th-grade students in West Virginia and provide a CEU opportunity for their teachers as well as all secondary education teachers throughout West Virginia. We would provide health education by creating a partnership with the National Network of Libraries of Medicine, the West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine (WVSOM), James R. Stookey Library, WVSOM Healthy Childrenâ€™s Initiative, and the West Virginia Board of Education.  There are 55 counties in West Virginia. Many of the schools in West Virginia are in rural areas. WVSOM will provide the programming through the Healthy Childrenâ€™s Initiative.  The James R. Stookey Library will provide the training using one or more of the NLM databases as their source on health care and the dangers of illicit drug use. The health behavior program for the children will consist of topics such as, opioids, exercise, eating more vegetables, the benefits of drinking more water or how to grow a garden.  Students will receive information and activities that include these topics.  In addition to offering valuable education to our students, we will also offer a CEU opportunity for all West Virginia secondary education teachers that will focus on how to approach the opioid epidemic in the classroom. All elementary schools in West Virginia will be provided DVDs and the curriculum needed to continue educating their students on good health behaviors. Representatives from WVSOM library will have an opportunity to speak to the students and teachers and help them locate information from the National Institute of Health such as MedLine Plus.

29597	16461.0	Public Libraries andâ€¯Health Information Outreach in the Time of COVID-19  	The rise of the COVID-19 pandemic called for individuals to seek out and apply health information at a rapid pace. The sheer amount of available information proved to be overwhelming, and the complexity, contradictory, and sometimes misinformation made an already difficult situation even more devastating. Historically, public libraries have been known for being community-centered institutions providingâ€¯equitableâ€¯access to informationâ€¯andâ€¯resources. Seen as trusted members of the community and the â€œgo-toâ€ for information, public librarians play an important role in improvingâ€¯individualâ€™sâ€¯access to healthâ€¯informationâ€¯and the overall well-being of their communities. Throughâ€¯this project we seek to assessâ€¯theâ€¯information needs of public librarians throughout Tennessee, specifically targeting health information practices related to COVID-19. The survey will better inform our educational efforts and aid in meeting NN/LMâ€™s goal of improving access toâ€¯information, enablingâ€¯communityâ€¯members to make more informed health decisions. Through educational outreach efforts, this project seeks to address community challenges to optimizing health and well-being through a health information training targeting public librarians throughout Tennessee. More specifically, the main objectives of thisâ€¯project are to better understand the roles and current practices of public librarians in providing consumer health information services within their libraries and to increase knowledge and utilization of high-quality health information resources of public library staff through the development of training and educational activities. Using the â€˜Train-the-Trainer&#039; approach, we aim to support public libraries in their ability to carry out health information and health literacy support in their communities to further support health equity throughout Tennessee.

29609	11593.0	TEACH Across Alabama:  Training, Educating, Advising, Connecting, and Helping Alabamaâ€™s Healthcare Workforce and Healthcare Consumers Navigate the COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 Global Pandemic	The COVID pandemic has highlighted the need for the long-overdue dissemination of appropriate, timely, and accurate information to the general public.  With the rising tide of misinformation and the safety of the public in jeopardy, it is imperative that people are trained to find the most accurate information from reliable sources.  Empowering individuals, community leaders, and engaged citizens with the tools to uncover accurate information lays the foundation for trust so that a sustainable web of understanding, information, and knowledge can be built.  Through strategic involvement of specific individuals, we will construct a network where individuals power the dissemination of these tools with a far-reach throughout the entire state of Alabama. We will bring this self-sustaining network to life through two specific aims.  First we plan to build a statewide network of healthcare providers to distribute information to patients and families. We will train physicians and medical students at our current state-wide clinical sites on the resources related to COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 by the NIH, NLM, and CDC. Training physicians and medical students who are actively seeing patients allows for an opportunity to disseminate information to the public from a trusted, reliable source. Secondly, we will build a local network of medical students to distribute and train individuals.  We will mentor medical students in the use of these tools mentioned above.  Students will disseminate information learned in their training to the public via specific community venues and classes. Mentoring students to teach the community how to use resources from the NIH, NLM, and others in community forums builds trust and community.

29735	20424.0	Health Literacy and Privacy in a Pandemic World	This project will provide quality virtual information related to health and wellness privacy and literacy that librarians can use to better serve their communities. We will present this information as a series of four webinars for public library workers. We will also create high-quality informational resources which will form part of the webinar content but will also be designed to be shared on library social media at other times. Authoritative information about health and wellness privacy is both timely and in-demand. There is a lot of fear and anxiety surrounding health and wellness programs and devices with regard to their privacy practices and a lack of informative resources addressing these concerns. Libraries are well-positioned to meet this need. This project is designed to address concerns, deliver factual information, and break issues down into easy to digest takeaways regarding both individual and systemic privacy issues related to health and wellness. While this virtual program will focus on public librarians within NJ, NY, DE, and PA, the presentations will be recorded and can be made available to the broader field of librarians via the NNLM and the grant partner organizations. Topics covered within this program tentatively include health privacy 101, players in the healthcare industry, health technology and digital records, and telehealth. Printable PDFs and other informational materials from the speakers and contributors to the project will be included as shareable takeaways for libraries to promote objectives to patrons including translation into Chinese to meet the needs of this often underserved community. Presenters and grant recipients will share relevant information from Medline and the All of Us research program during the webinars and will encourage attendees to sign up.

In tandem, TEA will create blog posts to accompany each podcast topic on its www.t-action.org and  sistahvoices.org websites. SISTAH Voices, (Sisters Inspiring Sisters to Activate Health), provides a unique forum for African American women to engage in interactive health education with community members and health professionals and to access health information resources. TEA created this forum since African American women play influential roles in the health of their families and are an important community partner to TEAâ€™s education programs and support the improvement of precision medicine in African Americans as a whole. In addition, TEA proposes to have a train-the trainer program with five faith-based leaders/organizations who will be trained on the All of Us Program, precision medicine, and NLM online health information resources to help increase knowledge and sustain the education of African Americans.
29773	22400.0	Informacion para tu Salud en tu Casa	"La Casa de Salud (LCS) is a not-for-profit organization whose mission is to improve the health and wellbeing of the Hispanic community by providing health information and resources and by facilitating the provision of health services through community  health workers (CHWs). Over the last two years, LCS has educated and trained approximately 30 CHWs and strategically placed them where they can serve the greater Richmond Hispanic community. LCS has provided a variety of services to over 1,000 individuals during this time. These services include: health education and information via face-to-face events, blood pressure and glucose screenings, access to mammograms, enrollment in Medicaid expansion, diabetes prevention and education, and referrals to safety net clinics and other community partners for services. Many of these services have been provided by LCS CHWs through partnership with several Latino-serving churches. LCS CHWs are trusted members of their communities and are recognized for their knowledge of community health information and resources. LCS operates a Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. telephone line for COVID-19 information and resources and to facilitate referrals to health and other services.  LCS uses its website and resources directory as digital tools to provide health information in Spanish and guide the community with health information needs that individuals and families may have. LCS also reaches out to the Hispanic community through its Facebook page and Facebook live events. Recent Facebook live events have had as many as 1,300 views. 
This project will enhance and extend our outreach efforts in the community through further CHW training to provide outreach in faith-based communities. As part of this project,  we plan two train-the-trainer sessions for eight (8) CHWs on finding reliable consumer health information in Spanish and how they can critically evaluate information for credibility in order to identify health misinformation.  The trainees will reach out to and inform the other (20) CHWs, LCS program groups and church leaders of critical health information and health information evaluation skills that they can share with their clients. This program will be a community engagement process allowing us to identify other community needs.  LCS staff will post on Facebook weekly  public health information from the CDC, the Virginia Department of Health and local counties to disseminate and reinforce key public health COVID-19 preventive measures messages.  Since LCS Facebook Live sessions have had successful experience during the last few months with thousands of viewers, we will continue to host key public health and clinical specialists to promote vaccination and COVID-19-related critical health issues.

The objective is to increase health literacy by distributing health information through the development of a newsletter, the implementation of health talk radio app and a series of health presentations/screenings in the community.  Individuals will be able to use the information to make informed decisions about their health. Our program is based on the evidence that there is no health education program in the Virgin Islands that offer solely health information and health newsletter to enable individuals to make decisions concerning their health. Research has shown that there is a relationship between low health literacy and health disparity. Individuals need to understand health information to take better care of themselves.

Project STAYâ€™s mission is to provide a medical â€œhomeâ€ for high-risk and HIV positive youth by creating opportunities for young people to receive comprehensive, integrated clinical and supportive services delivered by a team of experienced, interdisciplinary providers. New Alternatives for Homeless LGBT Youth has been a core member of the Project STAY network since 2010 and will be collaborating with Project STAY and CIPHER in this NNLM initiative. CIPHER, a partner of Project STAY, comprises multidisciplinary teams of talented public health graduate students and faculty advisors which seek to utilize evidence-based methods to make information more accessible by decoding public health concepts through community-informed health messaging and curriculum. Together these three organizations will work to increase the awareness of HIV and STI preventative behaviors, PEP and PrEP, and clinical support services utilizing HHS resources and tailoring them to the specific target audience of homeless LGBTQ+ youth in New York City. Furthermore, through this connection we will enhance linkage to care as high-risk youth and HIV+ youth who have been disconnected from care are directly connected to preventive and treatment services through Project STAY.

Our services are structured to support all youth, specializing in reaching young people who often experience barriers to accessing services. Although the HIV epidemic has begun seeing overall decreases nationally, young men who have sex with men of color (YMSMOC) are still acquiring HIV at increasing rates. YMSMOC are currently the most vulnerable population for HIV acquisition in Chicago, accounting for 48% of new diagnoses in 2018. In Chicago and around the nation, YMSMOC, young women of color (YWOC), and transgender women of color (TWOC) are also left behind and forgotten when it comes to accessing lifesaving HIV medication, prevention, treatment, and information.  

Chicago youth generally are at increased risk for HIV, accounting for 27% of all new diagnoses in 2018. Youth who are also MSMOC, WOC, and/or TWOC have higher risk levels which is why the Youth Information Access Project will invest in targeting and supporting these communities directly. The project will commission 6 young artists from high-risk populations and communities to design educational materials to provide their peers with information about HIV treatment, prevention, and education (including PrEP resources and NLM materials). Similar to past successful communications campaigns implemented by the Division, these youth-developed materials will be disseminated via social media outlets targeting at-risk youth. The outreach will connect youth to the NLM library of resources around HIV/AIDS and PrEP ensuring that they have the tools to access additional accurate information."

The project will utilize multiple focus groups that were held with adolescents and young adults who are living with HIV to create 8 unique â€œepisodesâ€ of a story about an HIV support group. The characters in the group will be racially and ethnically diverse, and will represent a variety of HIV stories (e.g. perinatally infected, infected through drug use, and infected through sexual transmission). Using real feedback and stories from adolescents and young adults, the stories will explore themes of mental health, adherence, and healthy sexuality. Each â€œepisodeâ€ will be 8 images, to be posted as an Instagram carousel, and all images will be combined into a high-quality comic book to be printed and distributed to clinics and CBOs.

29800	16471.0	University of Cincinnati HIV/AIDS Workshop Series 	"The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is entirely preventable, yet each year tens of the thousands of Americans are newly infected with the virus. As these numbers continue to increase, estimates have indicated that prevention and treatment are not reaching those who could most benefit, and that subgroups of this populate are disproportionately affected [1]. Notably, men who have sex with men and African American males consistently have the highest incidence rates [1]. Stigma at the community level has been documented as a barrier to HIV prevention [2]. Role model stories have been shown to be an effective method of providing training, education, and prevention strategies in the HIV/AIDS community [3]. Thus, the University of Cincinnati Health Sciences Library is partnering with the Midwest AIDS Training + Education Center to bring awareness, advocacy, education and training centered on HIV/AIDS. Through this partnership, we will provide a total of three training opportunities for the general public and targeted workshops centered around peer advocacy for individuals infected and affected by HIV/AIDS.  These workshops will be a continuation a workshop to be held on November 30, 2020 that will be held as part of our World AIDS Day Symposium https://libraries.uc.edu/worldaidsday.html. This workshop entitled: Staying Positive: Winning, Living, and Thriving with HIV will be facilitated by an HIV peer-educator/advocate and will focus on advocacy, self-care, and stigma. This workshop will provide an ideal platform to introduce these upcoming workshops. The proposed workshops will focus on the use of storytelling and peer interactions as a means to educate, reduce stigma, promote advocacy, and encourage self-care in an effort to decrease the spread of HIV/AIDS in high-risk populations and encourage self-care and use of public HIV services among those infected with HIV.

The project activities follow community engagement and empowerment approaches with the main goal to support the work of the NNLM while facilitating recruitment and retention of participants to All of Us that will ultimately contribute to meeting the national program goal of enrolling one-million persons of diverse backgrounds that will participate in future studies to advance personalized medicine. During January 1, 2021 to April 30, 2021, the project will develop bilingual educational materials, conduct health education events and engage in other community outreach activities, including linkages with MedlinePlus and MedlinePlus en Espanol, a consumer friendly, evidence-based health information from the National Library of Medicine.  
29854	61226.0	Digital Health Literacy Resource Development Plan	"The Network of the National Library of Medicine (NNLM) is partnering with the All of Us Research Program (All of Us) to provide resources for NNLM members to support their communities as they access and use health information online and participate in medical research studies, particularly All of Us. A key component of this partnership is the goal of reaching people who are on the other side of the digital divide. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the widening digital divide. According to the Pew Research Center, â€œroughly half of U.S. adults (53%) say the internet has been essential for them personally during the pandemic.â€ 

To support the objectives of the partnership and address the digital divide, NNLM will work with Wisconsin Health Literacy (WHL) to develop several materials and activities on digital health literacy that NNLM members can use to engage with their communities both in person and online. Specifically, this project will support the development of five program gudies for libraries, a digital health literacy video series, and subject matter experts for a virtual programming series.

The All of Us NIH national partner Community &amp; Provider Gateway Initiative (CPGI) management will partner with NNLM to co-create the project deliverables, ensuring that they are developed utilizing best practices for engagement with key populations, including imagery, wording, and other design elements. CPGI partner organizations who work directly with populations underrepresented in biomedical research (UBR) will be recruited by CPGI to participate in several creation planning meetings facilitated by WHL and to provide feedback on the deliverables. The final deliverables will be available for use by the NNLM Community Engagement Network (CEN), All of Us Community Engagement Partners, and the entire NNLM.

29887	25000.0	Community Health Literacy Training	For this award of $25,000 P. I. Advocates International, Inc. (PIA) will teach and/or improve peoplesâ€™ computer skills in accessing high quality web-based health information and simultaneously improve their understanding of health literacy and the importance for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. We will delegate full attention to training as many people as possible doing the period of this contract which is from January 2021 to April 31 2021. PIA is introducing this project as â€œcommunity level health literacy trainingâ€. Through our community position we are committed to combating cultural differences and disparities impeding  appropriate healthcare. We have developed the ability to identify comprehension levels of our targeted populations (mostly seniors) and will use medlineplus.gov as a teaching tool. We have found medlineplus.gov easy for navigating and explaining health information written at a 6th grade reading level. As a supporter of NLMsâ€™ and the â€œAll of Usâ€ research program we will use NLMsâ€™ health information databases. Facilitators will utilize our proven hands-on computer training in PowerPoint slides format to accomplish project goals. After twenty years of offering these workshops we have found that health information housed in The National Library of Medicine/NIH databases can empower people to make informed decisions about their health. We have also found that very few of our targeted populations are unaware of these health resources. Our project is an easy-to-learn hands-on educational program designed for community folk, especially the underserved.  Conducting our own needs assessment, we have discovered that certain population segments in our targeted communities are more likely to have low general literacy along with low health literacy. We have also noticed that some individuals within these segments are not even aware of the importance of controlling risk factors for disease infections. In a lot of these settings people exhibited trouble associating risk factors with personal actions. This funding will support two outreach teams (two facilitators per teamâ€”a lead facilitator and an assistant facilitator). Each outreach team members have studied CDCâ€™s online health literacy classes, and all have adequate computer skills. Both teams will follow the latest COVID-19 prevention guidelines and will be tested at least biweekly.

and across the world. The disruptions are far-reaching and have required major adjustments in
our lives. And yet, our experiences over centuries remind us that people living in this country are
resilient and capable of overcoming what appear to be insurmountable obstacles. Maintaining a
sense of normalcy in turbulent times has been a critically important survival strategy.
Its In The Genes, LLC (IITG) has had the privilege of engaging some of the most resilient residents
of the District of Columbia. Our Health &amp; Wellness programs have enabled us to get to know
hundreds of District citizens, who survive tough challenges on a daily basis. Based on the
reports and data captured by IITG the demand and the need of delivering Virtual Health and
Wellness Classes provides a welcome and much anticipated opportunity for release and relief.
In preparing for the Spring/Summer 2020 series of Wellness Series, Its In The Genes, LLC (IITG)
has engaged over 160 individuals who have signed up to participate. We know from experience
that some will not continue to be eligible to participate for the entire series and some not at all. We also know that of the 160 individuals, typically 40 would appear in person. However, these
are individuals who have clearly indicated that they seek to learn how to take charge of their
health. Responding to current realities, Its In The Genes, LLC (IITG) wants to continue to share
information with the Trusted Health Plan enrollees we have recruited information regarding how
to prevent complications to their diabetes and hypertension - information that will help them be
more resistant to the coronavirus. To summarize, we at Its In The Genes (IITG) feel a strong obligation to â€œkeep the faithâ€ with
these individuals and give them the opportunity, even in the midst of the current crisis, to
advance their knowledge and hopefully, take the steps they can take to improve their health.
Its In The Genes, LLC (IITG) is proposing to implement a Virtual Health and Wellness Classes in
order to respond to these individuals. Due to the current widespread threat of the coronavirus
and the vulnerability of our participants, who all have either diabetes and or high blood pressure, group gatherings have been banned by the District of Columbia. This is clearly necessary.Our
answer is to create a Virtual Health and Wellness program that will be conducted by means of
conference calls until such time as Virtual Health and Wellness Classes in person can reconvene.

29976	36351.0	Ethical Considerations of Data: A Curriculum for Health Sciences Librarians	"As librarians and researchers alike grapple with new technologies and methodologies for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating data, they must also grapple with corresponding ethical issues. In order to assist librarians with these concerns, we proposed to create educational materials to aid in the recognition, analysis, and solution of ethical issues, including but not limited to ethical data visualization, ethics related to data sharing, and ethical issues for machine learning methodologies. The curriculum will focus on some of the issues that health sciences librarians face, particularly regarding human subjects and patient data, but it will be generalizable to the larger library community.  

The curriculum will not aim to be prescriptive, instead it will give participants the tools to approach their unique data ethics problems. Through this grant, we aim to build and pilot a curriculum of synchronous courses consisting of three one-hour classes. Following the pilot, we will evaluate the materials with the assistance of participants to further refine the curriculum to meet participant needs. We hope to help build resources and foster community with people who are interested in data, ethics, and biomedical research.

29979	2526.0	Health-Info-Equity:  Delivering Accurate Information in Southern New Jersey AHEC Communities	Project Health-Info-Equity will provide AHEC Scholar learning activities and take-away outreach consumer health materials to help them understand what is health information literacy. This will provide them with skills they can use to educate their current and future primary care patients about simple and consistent ways that online information can be assessed for accuracy, potential biases, and intention. Just as there are healthcare inequities that perpetuate illness and premature mortality, health information inequities can lead to inaccurate beliefs, wasted income, and behavioral choices with negative health consequences. Besides creating a curriculum for AHEC Scholars, the project will also provide National Library of Medicine (NLM) health information material and originally designed healthcare provider pocket cards. An assessment of how health information distribution takes place in the seven AHEC counties will be evaluated. AHEC Scholars interested in health information careers can participate in this community evaluation.

30112	46251.0	Addressing COVID-19 Concerns in Amish Country	"     Amish settlements can be found in 31 states in the US, and Ohio is home to two of the worldâ€™s largest communities.  Many communities follow a collectivistic lifestyle where faith and community are prioritized over self, and technology is often limited due to its intrusion on family life and values. Outbreaks of COVID-19 have been observed in locations where Amish communities reside, and results of a current survey of Amish community members noted a lack of access to health information and misinformation about the COVID-19 / SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic.  

     The goal of this outreach program is to increase access to evidence-based and culturally sensitive health information about COVID-19 / SARS-CoV-2 and to address common myths and misinformation about COVID-19 / SARS-CoV-2 and vaccines among Amish communities.  Our community-led program, titled â€œAddressing COVID-19 Concerns in Amish Countryâ€, aims to develop and disseminate  a culturally sensitive COVID-19 Fact Sheet for Amish communities and to provide a COVID-19 hotline to Amish community members staffed by a trained community member who can speak the primary language and address questions and misinformation.  The proposed outreach program is the first to specifically address the cultural and access needs of COVID-19 health information among Amish communities and can serve as a best practices model that can be replicated across the country.

30115	20201.0	"Kina (""Together"")"	 Kina (â€œTogetherâ€) will serve Native Americans (Ojibwe) in northern Minnesota. This project has been developed through partnerships between the University of Minnesota Medical School Duluth Campus (UMMS Duluth), Department of Biomedical Sciences (BMS) and Bois Forte Health and Human Services, Oshki Ogimaag Charter School located on Grand Portage Reservation, and ISD #361 Indian Education Program, International Falls, Minnesota. All the communities are served are severely underserved and lie in remote areas of the state. The three communities are also categorized as DHHS Health Professions Shortage Areas and Medically Underserved Areas as well as USDA food deserts with both low food access and low-income populations. Minnesota is home to the nationâ€™s worst Native American health disparities; these same disparities have contributed to disproportionate COVID-19 infection and death rates among the stateâ€™s Native Americans. At root of these disparities are multiple social determinants of health, including long-standing food insecurity which has been exacerbated by COVID-19. The coming together of community members to strengthen connectedness and engage in traditions and ceremonies have been core elements of Ojibwe culture for thousands of years and have been a central to resiliency, coping, and wellbeing. The practice of these essential survival mechanisms has been severely limited by the emergence COVID-19.  Kina provides safe options tailored to priority needs, including gathering as a community. This will be achieved using virtual, culturally tailored activities to promote 1) COVID-19 awareness, 2) practice of COVID-19 safety, 3) COVID-19 and online media literacy, 4) food sovereignty to help curtail long-standing food insecurity that negatively impacts health and has been exacerbated COVID-19.

The project will target CPL branch libraries located in areas with a large population that meets the NIH underrepresented in biomedical research (UBR) criteria in order to provide training for CPL librarians on using and promoting quality health resources.  This project will partner with University of Chicago Library and University of Chicago Medicine organizations with national expertise in the areas of precision medicine and community health, including: the Institute for Population and Precision Health, the Center for Community Health and Vitality, the Pritzker School of Medicine, and the Office of Community Engagement and Cancer Disparities.  A speaker series will feature these experts, who will discuss priority health topics that align with the NLMâ€™s priorities and UChicago Medicineâ€™s latest Community Health Needs Assessment.

30957	26746.0	Covid-19 information outreach for the homeless and people with opioid use disorders: Creating a train-the-trainer program to promote health information to a high risk population	Margaret Zimmerman, an Assistant Professor with the Florida State Universityâ€™s (FSUâ€™s) School of Information (SI) requests a grant for a Train the Trainer project to be developed and piloted with volunteers and professionals directly serving the NIH health disparity population of people who experience homelessness (socioeconomically disadvantaged) and people who possibly use opioids such as heroin and fentanyl. The proposed training will be in response to the COVID-19 health crisis. This grant will build upon Dr. Zimmermanâ€™s previous experience working in health information outreach to underserved populations to improve the health literacy of members of these groups. While the opioid crisis has exploded since the introduction of fentanyl, people who use these narcotics have traditionally been medically underserved due to the stigma and illegality of their substance abuse issues. They experience a disproportionate rate of homelessness, hunger, and endemic poverty (Matto and Cleaveland, 2016). In a time when people in the United States are more isolated than ever due to quarantining practices and the suspension of some social services, people with opioid use disorders (OUDs) may be at heightened risk for contracting the novel coronavirus. The population of people who experience homelessness and OUDs have a significantly increased likelihood of contracting infectious diseases, along with heightened rates of morbidity, than the general population (Degenhardt et al., 2019; Hser et al., 2017; Wiese et al., 2018). The project that is being proposed is to develop training and curricular materials, with the assistance of a graduate student of health communication and a public health expert and based upon the materials provided by NIH, NLM, and the CDC, to assist volunteers and professionals that work and directly interact with the homeless population and people who suffer from OUDs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This will include people who staff homeless shelters in the Florida panhandle, community health workers who work at organizations serving those with OUDs, and public librarians who often find themselves at the front lines of the combined crises of homelessness and opioid use. By creating and disseminating these materials, this project will improve health information access for patrons and the public relating to COVID-19, assist in providing access to health information for those experiencing homelessness and OUDs, increase awareness and utilization of NIH, NLM, and CDC as authoritative resources on COVID-19, and provide training and create resources relating to COVID-19 for the benefit of librarians, community health workers, and other health information intermediaries.
31229	24348.0	Native Health Database Metadata Migration	The University of New Mexicoâ€™s (UNM) Health Sciences Library &amp; Informatics Center (HSLIC) is responsible for the Native Health Database (https://hslic-nhd.health.unm.edu/), an indexed database containing 10,046 descriptions of resources related to the history (of) and health related topics focused on (predominantly) United States Indigenous populations, including Alaska Native communities. In order to sustain this resource, HSLIC staff and faculty have identified an immediate need to migrate the metadata from its current infrastructure and move it into a new database, using the Dublin Core metadata standard. Dublin Core is a formal standardized (ISO 15836) structure for describing resources. This project is the the beginning of a multi-phased approach to responsible collaboration between agencies (regionally, nationally, internationally) and source communities, with a particular emphasis on responsible sharing of health information resources that are mutually focused on the improvement of health outcomes among Indigenous populations.

31942	24992.0	If We Build It, Will They Come?	The ongoing coronavirus pandemic is devastating.  The loss of lives is staggering, with over one million lives lost worldwide, and over 200,000 deaths in the United States alone.  The full impact of the pandemic is still unknown, but the ramifications are extensive and dire.  Multiple labs around the globe are working to create effective vaccines, and the possibility that one or more will be available in the coming months is a beacon of hope for many.  However, achieving the benefits of a vaccine requires another step as well â€“ the vaccine will only be effective if there is uptake.  Influenza vaccines have been available in the United States for many years, but less than half of the population is vaccinated each year.  Simply publicizing recommendations for vaccination is insufficient.  Our team recently surveyed a nationally representative sample of approximately 1,000 US adults and found that only 57% intended to be vaccinated when a coronavirus vaccine becomes available.  This percentage was even lower among people who identified as Black or Hispanic (39% and 43% respectively), those with a high school education or less (46%) and those in the lowest income groups (49% of those reporting a household income of $30,000 or less, compared to 72% of those reporting a household income of $100,000 or more).  We asked those who indicated they would not or might not get vaccinated for their reasons and found that some individuals may be willing to be vaccinated if provided specific information about the vaccine such as side effects, and effectiveness.  Others expressed generalized skepticism, fear and distrust of vaccines, with some even referring to currently circulating anti-vaccine conspiracy theories.  Our findings are consistent with an extensive body of research suggesting an urgent need to proactively develop and test interventions to maximize vaccination rates when a coronavirus vaccine becomes available.  We seek to address this need by creating and testing targeted messages to address the concerns of subgroups of people at risk for not being vaccinated with the ultimate goal of maximizing vaccine uptake when a coronavirus vaccine becomes available.   We will accomplish this by working with an existing online panel of volunteers, which will allow efficient, focused data gathering.  Results of the first round of the survey will provide a nuanced, current description of how vulnerable adults perceive the coronavirus and forthcoming vaccines, which will be used as the basis for developing messages and communication strategies.   In the second round we will test different versions of messages intended to reduce vaccine hesitancy and support uptake.   This project will ultimately result in a set of tested, evidence-derived messages about vaccination for COVID-19.  We will make these messages available, together with evidence how these influence members of vulnerable populationsâ€™ understanding of vaccination, and disease risk, as well as intent to be vaccinated.   The messages will be freely available for use by organizations and providers seeking to improve communication about a coronavirus vaccine.

Links to MEDLINEplus (English and Spanish versions), to ClinicalTrials.gov, to TOXNET and to PubMed will be highlighted. Other NLM databases will be reviewed for possible inclusion.  The Web site will also include additional local resources, many of the currently liked online resources and selected health promotion sources that address community concerns.  The resulting Web site (English and Spanish versions) will be tested in the same community and in three other locations throughout the city.  Following implementation of needed changes, the new DPL Health/Medicine Web site will be launched on the parent site and be freely available on the Internet.

1002350	7023.0	Creation of a Library Portal	"DESCRIPTION: The objective of this project is to increase the access to digital collections by the health services personnel at Sound Shore Medical Center and Mount Vernon Hospital through the purchase of four new computers, connecting these computers to the hospital's T1 line, and the creation of a library website to organize access to digital resources. There already exists potential access to a large number of digital resources at Sound Shore and Mount Vernon. Through the National Library of Medicine there is access to PubMed, Medline Plus, NLM Gateway, PubMed Central, Consumer Health, DOCLINE, and Loansome Dec; through New York State's EmpireLink there is access to Gale's Health Reference Center, a full-text collection of medical and consumer health information; through the Metropolitan New York Library Council's Hospital Library Services Program there is access to StatRef, a fult-text collection of over thirty medical textbooks, and access to Harrison's Online. In addition, the libraries provide access to OVID's LWW Collection, a full-text collection of 140 medical journals, which include access to OVID's search interface for MedLine. What is needed to maximize the usage of these resources is their organization by a professional librarian. The proposed library website will serve as that portal to guide health professionals through the maze of variagated resources by providing introductions explaining the scope of each database and their arrangement in a logical order. Finally, connecting the libraries to a high speed connection will increase the usability of the website and the databases and allow the librarian to be ""online"" to provide assistance to either site.

The project will fund the purchase of equipment (computer/scanner/printer) and software (Ariel/Prospero) to be used for the electronic transfer of documents over the Internet, both directly to the library users, and library to library using Ariel.  While the primary benefactors of this service will be the library users of the Frontier School, the library also serves as a source of specialized materials on midwifery and women's health for other libraries throughout the United States.  Specifically, the equipment will be used to: scan articles from journals in the library collection and deliver them to off site patrons via the Internet; scan articles in the collection and provide them to other libraries using Ariel; receive articles from other libraries via Ariel; and transfer articles received from other libraries directly to the patron via the Internet.

1002450	1250.0	TI Award: Delivery of Clinical Information Tools via Internet to Handheld Devices	"DESCRIPTION: Technology Improvement Award: ""Delivery of Clinical Information Tools via Internet to Handheld Devices of Clinical Practitioners"" The Library Services Department of Allina Hospitals and Clinics (Allina) is a multi-site, multi-hospital unit that serves more than 2000 physicians in four Twin Cities metro area hospitals, 11 regional hospitals, and numerous owned and affiliated clinics.  Many practitioners in the Allina environment are acquiring and using hand-held devices, but have expressed frustration and disappointment to Library Services and Information Services (IS) staff about the barriers to use within the network.  The objective is to provide an obstacle free method of distributing the already licensed content from the library's electronic resources to mobile handheld devices for use at point of care and in training and education.  As a result, all Knowledge Consultants will possess equipped hand-held devices to take to training and orientation sessions; clinic physicians will download and use tools not currently available at point of care; and hospital practitioners will have a full set of electronic resources that can be updated regularly upon visit to the library.  The funds from this grant will be used to purchase two complete multi-media personal computer workstations, infrared and cradle syncing accessories compatible with current Allina standard purchase models.  The workstations will be installed in the library and will be used to download, test, install, and upgrade hand-held versions of licensed electronic clinical information to be used by hospital and clinic based practitioners.  The initial service will be offered to the staff of units already using hand-held devices, e.g. medical education residency programs, emergency room physicians, and the hospitalist and intensivist staffs.

1002451	1000.0	TI Award: Enhanced Service Options for Document Delivery and Interlibrary Loan	DESCRIPTION: Technology Improvement Award: The Bio-Medical Library intends to expand and enhance the use of electronic delivery.  Electronic delivery (either Ariel to Ariel or to the desktop) will become the standard rather than the exception.  In order to meet this intent, the library will need additional equipment and software to extend beyond current capabilities, in an atmosphere of budgetary constraints.  Therefore, the Bio-Medical Library is applying for this grant to purchase a high-volume scanner, Ariel software, and a computer workstation.  This equipment and software would be used to provide widespread electronic delivery and receipt of articles and other documents both from the library's collection and through Interlibrary Loan.  Primary clients using PhotoDelivery and Interlibrary Loan Borrowing, and secondary clients using Interlibrary Loan Lending, are the target groups.  The library's intent is to expand current electronic delivery in a thoughtful and controlled progression in order to meet the project's goals and objectives and assure anticipated outcomes.

1002662	1110.0	TI Award: Bringing Electronic Document Delivery to Rural Wisconsin	DESCRIPTION: Technology Improvement Award: This project will add new and improved information services to health care professionals in Juneau County, Wisconsin.  This, in turn, will provide informed and timely health care for members of the community.  Electronic document delivery via the Internet will enhance user access to vital health information.  The project has two interrelated goals: to provide electronic document delivery of medical information to rural Juneau County's health care professionals and; to increase and enhance Hess Memorial Hospital, Inc.'s participation in interlibrary loan networks, especially as a resource to other small rural hospitals.  This proposal will require the purchase of a scanner, the Ariel Version 3.3 Document Delivery System and Adobe Acrobat Version 6.0.  Through electronic document delivery, the Health Science Library will be able to share its medical information resources more efficiently and cost-effectively with other rural hospital libraries via email and Web postings.  This will help health care professionals apply current information technologies, information and education to their practices and ultimately lead to a healthier rural community.

1002663	1666.6666666666667	TI Award: Tech Trek: the Wireless Path to Point-of-Care	DESCRIPTION: Technololgy Improvement Award: The Library of the Health Sciences, Peoria has been a leader in introducing handheld technology in the medical curriculum and has shared its experience with other health sciences libraries.  State-of-the-art equipment with wireless access will assist the Library in expanding its handheld technology initiative, continuing its integration of PDA resources in the curriculum, and remaining at the forefront of instruction and technical support.  We propose to purchases at least five handheld devices with varying features, representing both Palm OS and Windows OS Pocket PC devices.  To improve access to resources, devices will be equipped for wireless Internet or cellular Internet capability.  A universal sync station will be purchased to accommodate a variety of PDA products, thus eliminating the need for multiple model-specific solutions.  Classes will be offered to students, faculty, and staff on key PDA resources such as NLM's PubMed on Tap; UIC licensed products; freeware such as ePocrates; and HanDbase and Presenter-to-Go, to be purchased with award funds.  Students and preceptors in the Rural Student Physician Program will be given equal access to products and classes will be offered at the clinical sites.   The Library supports this technology because it offers convenient point-of-care information access that fosters evidence-based decision-making and the development of life-long learning habits.

Both consumer and clinical health information on the research, prevention and treatment of suicide will be presented. The partnership of UK MCL and HOB will allow both organizations the ability to expand the delivery of library outreach services that they provide to the citizens of Kentucky as well as reach a population not previously targeted.  After consulting with various professionals regarding the suggested approach to take with this particular topic, it was decided that due to the complex and critical nature of the subject matter (suicide) the clinical staff will be targeted directly for project training activities with the intent that the information sources can then be disseminated to the consumer through means considered appropriate by the mental health specialists.

Participants will be able to listen to and explore health topics of interest to seniors, and then be able to ask questions of the experts.  By using this flexible new technology, the two organizations will reach a broader audience of seniors, regardless of their location within the state of Illinois, income level, mobility, transportation options, or access to media.

The purpose of this project is to enhance the knowledge, skills, and ability of pre- and post-doctoral students to recognize how local environmental conditions can affect health and disease and integrate such knowledge into the differential diagnosis of commonly treated diseases. The goals include: 1) Develop a training course in environmental health for pre and post-doctoral students (medical and dental students, interns and residents in training) at the Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science (CRDUMS); 2) Develop methods to familiarize the students and their patients with the content and instructions on how to search the medical, toxicological and environmental health information available from the NLM website and other Internet resources, and 3) Identify means to implement and sustain the training course. The primary target groups are physician post graduates and medical students completing their clinical clerkships at CRDUMS. The physician post graduates are primary and specialty physicians and dentists whose training takes place in an underserved area of South Central Los Angeles County.  This course will be integrated as a part of the Primary Care training programs' curricula for primary care training.

The details of project design are outlined below, followed by the methodology in the next section. This outreach initiative has five specific objectives. To implement a health information access network relationship with two partners at local senior centers using the PCOM website as its hub. To train patients and the public at the senior centers and staff to use electronic information resources to enhance their knowledge of personal and family senior health concerns. There will be a series of workshop classes on access to databases by taking computers to the sites and also by using on site computers to provide training workshops.
1002979	10000.0	Access to Electronic Health Information: Design and Implementation of Web-based Video Library	DESCRIPTION: The complete name of the project is Design and  Implementation of Wed-based Video Library of Neuromuscular Channelopathies. This project targets the Specific Interests of: Primary Care Physicians who have a limited knowledge of, or access to information specific to the diagnosis and care of individuals suffering from Periodic Paralysis and Non-dystrophic Myotonias, and members of the Clinical Research Community focusing on work associated with the Periodic Paralyses and Non-dystrophic Myotonias. In addition, it serves the members of the public including patients and family members or other caretakers or interested parties. General Objectives: The promotion of improved information access mechanisms for the rare disease community. To encourage and model innovative information systems for special medical needs. To identify and make accessible the products and services of NLM and the NN/LM to the still underserved community of rare disease. To improve access to health information for both health professionals and health consumers without adequate access to library and information services.
1002980	32392.0	Access to Electronic Health Information: Verde Valley and Yavapai County Outreach	"DESCRIPTION: The Objectives of this project are to provide educational sessions, especially ""Train-the-Trainers"" at each of the partner sites. It is also the goal to provide information to the other target audiences regarding the services that are provided by the partner sites, especially VVMC medical library. The rationale for this project is to help direct the consumer to quality health information provided by quality sites such as MedlinePlus and PubMed. Currently, the public libraries will show the patron where the medical information is located but will not help them to research their particular needs. The Verde Valley Guidance Center and Catholic Social Services currently do not provide this service to their patrons. The First Steps program currently uses MedlinePlus for consumer health information. The expected results of this project will be to provide more sites where consumers can access the necessary health information."

1003173	24239.0	Go Local Missouri	"DESCRIPTION: In 2004, Missouri became the second state to offer Go Local links from MedlinePlus.  The Missouri model uses an existing database, Community Connection, (http://www.communityconnection.org) which contains information on community resources in Missouri and surrounding counties.    While the Community Connection database is an excellent source for links to organizations, agencies and government units, to date no systematic attempt has been made to identify health related support groups.  Since support groups are one of the most important reasons why a health consumer might want to ""Go Local,"" this aspect of the database will be developed in two ways:  1) by hiring a half-time graduate library student devoted to identifying and recommending resources to add to the community connection database; 2) by enlisting the help of local specialists; contact people around the state who can recommend nearby organizations and support groups from their part of the state.    Community Connection is ""a central source with decentralized control,"" meaning that each organization is responsible for entering and editing their own records in the database.  With so many individuals entering data, indexing consistency can be compromised. A half-time graduate library student will be hired to review existing database records to ensure that all organizations of a given type, e.g. nursing homes, are similarly indexed to ensure consistent retrieval.

1003188	40000.0	New Hanover County Public Library - Health Information in the Community Project	DESCRIPTION: New Hanover County Public Library proposes to establish an outreach project aimed at improving access to health information for the whole community, but with special emphasis on certain high-risk and significantly underserved segments of a diverse population The first phase of the project will serve the community in general, by offering classes in basic computer skills and locating reliable health information on the Internet. These classes will be held in a variety of locations such as community centers, health centers, libraries, and faith communities. The second phase will reach specific groups in underserved and at-risk populations.  They will identify organizations and individuals serving people in these groups and work with them to establish resource centers where key personnel will be trained to assist people in finding basic health information. The centers will provide computer access for people in the community and classes will be held for community members as needed. They propose to provide training to a wide range of people including librarians, teachers, health professionals, and the general public, thereby capturing those who research independently and those who can assist others in their respective communities. By taking this dual approach, all of the target populations will be positively impacted by this outreach project.

1003209	4989.5	Consumer Health Award: Libraries as a Leading Resource for Community Poison Prevention Education	DESCRIPTION: Consumer Health Award: Families are increasingly turning to librarians as a resource for health care information — the Illinois Poison Center (IPC) wants to leverage this trend to raise awareness of the IPC and to provide poison prevention education to young children and their parents. Libraries have a natural built-in audience of families with young children, which until now has been an untapped by the IPC. The Consumer Health Award from NN/LM GMR gives the IPC the opportunity for the first time to utilize this resource. Our objective is to educate librarians on how they can weave poison prevention messages into their programming starting with National Poison Prevention Week, March 19-26, 2006. IPC will provide librarians with a comprehensive tool kit with educational materials, activities for children and a promotional card so that librarians and parents alike can register online to become poison prevention volunteers. Community volunteers are vital to the long-term success of the IPC's poison prevention program, so that in turn, the IPC can help parents to keep their children safe from poisons and other hazards in the home. Volunteers will receive information regarding online health information such as IllinoisPoisonCenter.org and National Library of Medicine products. Through this concerted effort, we intend for librarians to play an ongoing role in providing poison prevention education to parents and children in their community.
1003210	10000.0	Consumer Health Award: Charlevoix Health Information Project	DESCRIPTION: The Consumer Health Award would allow the Charlevoix Public Library to extend its outreach efforts to more people in the community.

By training library staff, the library will be able to offer reference assistance to patrons at the library. The ultimate result would be an expansion of consumer health information services in this rural community.

Also, the breast health kits (in VHS and DVD formats) will be mailed to any interested parties during course of the project. Additional information, in Vietnamese, will be available in the Warren Reynolds Library of The Lacks Cancer Center as a follow up to the breast health kits. By reaching out to this group in their community using a culturally sensitive tool and education materials, we will increase awareness about breast health and cancer prevention -- an important subject that is currently ignored by this group.

Some of these materials are very fragile and require limited access in order to preserve them for future generations.  Other of these materials are uncatalogued and underutilized.  The potential of digitization to open these materials to the world is an opportunity that is as yet untapped at the Ebling Library.  Our goal is to enable the educator, researcher, and general public to maximize their use of our historical materials, to inspire them to partner with others to share information and to empower them to search their own collections to find materials to share with the world.  Together we may have an opportunity to advance knowledge and to have a positive impact on the practice of medicine.

There is a need for the health professionals affiliated with the WCPHD to locate resources and develop a guide to help them serve their population using PubMed, MedlinePlus, CDC resources, evidence-based resources and others. We have identified a need for training on how to use the resources, identifying the best resources to use, developing quick guides to the resources, and obtaining the articles, books, and other materials identified though the searches. Secondary concerns are materials in a language other than English and at a reading level below fifth grade.

1003372	28000.0	Regional Community Health Information Outreach Symposium	"DESCRIPTION: Effective community health information outreach is an important initiative to reduce health disparities. In order to make inroads, it will take more than RML staff. Organizations and libraries may need to increase their knowledge of their importance in providing access to health information in their communities. In addition, it is often difficult for libraries and agencies to recognize who their best community allies are for this outreach. The symposium is one of the steps toward building a critical mass of individuals and agencies promoting and providing health information access for communities and community organizations. Objectives The NN/LM MCR foresees the following outcomes as a result of the regional symposium. These are not immediate outcomes but long term results for which the seeds will be planted at this meeting.  1.	More public libraries will offer health information outreach projects. 2.	More health sciences libraries will target a community based organization for outreach services. 3.	More health sciences libraries will offer services to their communities. 4.	More health sciences libraries and public libraries will partner in community outreach efforts. 5.	More community outreach efforts will incorporate evaluation.

My project will update and add to the equipment available for the Southeast Clinical Campus Librarian/UND School of Medicine and Health Sciences. While I currently have an adequate laptop computer and monochrome printer, I lack flexibility that would be available through upgrading of the equipment. Since I am not at the main campus library, I am dependent on the generosity of others in the School of Medicine's SE Campus Center for letting me use their computer projector, scanner and speakerphone. I am very involved in providing instructional sessions that directly support the medical curriculum on our campus and the majority of my time is spent teaching and preparing instructional materials. Since I serve clients over a great geographical area, the ability to provide instruction and support in a wide variety of formats is crucial. Within the Fargo area, I travel weekly to hospitals and other facilities to provide instruction on access to health care information through utilization of NLM/NNLM resources. I use my office extensively for working with individuals and small groups. The requested new equipment will allow me to do my job more efficiently and provide new opportunities for outreach and instruction with my clients.

1003414	2260.0	TI Award: Upgrade from Copier to Copier-Scanner	DESCRIPTION: Technology Improvement Award: Upgrade from Copier to Copier-Scanner to VA Illiana Health Care System Library, Illinois, for $4,520, November 1, 2005 - April 30, 2006. The VAIHCS library has seen an increase in the number of articles that have been requested, printed, and distributed. As VAIHCS is a medical facility and governmental institution, we have also seen a change in the number of article requests that we get from other facilities. The document center would allow the library to scan the Table of Contents from all professional journals and transmit them to their e-mail accounts. Staff would make more journal requests, receive e-copies of the requested articles and be better informed - allowing them to provide better patient care to our nation's veterans.

Library faculty will collaborate with basic scientists and clinicians to accomplish this.  The goal is to replace some of the current lecture-based teaching with the interactive tutorials.

The project incorporates a particular focus on emergency response organizations, such as 9-1-1, police and fire departments, to educate them about resources that can assist them in preparing and responding to disaster situations.  This includes NNLM resources such as PubMed, the Household Products Database, ToxTown, TOXNET and HazMap that are not as well-utilized as they can be to support risk reduction and effective emergency response in the event of a public health crisis or hazardous materials incident.

1004117	7500.0	Technology Improvement Award- Improve Library Staff Online Workflow	DESCRIPTION: This project will help the library staff utilize our online resources more efficiently and in so doing improve customer services.  The library has been working very hard this past year to advance library services to our patrons.  We have succeeded in updating and expanding library access to databases; extended library hours; updating our print /electronic book collection; all of these innovations to improve library services.  As a result of our efforts library user ship has increased; with this increase, demand for electronic dissemination of knowledge-based literature has also increased.  We have come to a realization that the staff does  not have computer equipment equivalent to this task.  We are looking to purchase, for the library staff, faster higher tech computers, printers and a new fax machine in order to better disseminate the information requested by our patrons.
1004118	2870.0	Technology Improvement Award- Added workstations & upgraded scanner for enhanced library patron serv	DESCRIPTION: This project will increase the library workstations from one to three and upgrade a scanner for processing articles for interlibary loans and emailing journal tables-of-contents to patrons.

1004123	20000.0	Library Space and It's Impact Conference Award- Transformational Change in Health Sciences Libraries	"DESCRIPTION: ""Transformational Change in Health Sciences Libraries: Space, Collections, Roles"".  Pat Thibodeau will present the keynote address focusing on changes in health sciences libraries in general, changes at Duke Medical Center Library, and implications for librarian roles and the need to transform skill sets: ""Library and librarian identity in light of changing or reduced physical space.""  Two panel discussions with Q&A format will address the conference themes.  Four panelists, two hospital librarians and two academic librarians, will respond to pre-determined questions.  The panelists will receive the pre-determined questions prior to the conference.    Major themes to be discussed: 1-  Models and best practices in libraries' reduction of print collection. 2-  Models and best practices in libraries' reduction of space and/or re-purposing of existing space. 3-  Emerging roles and identities of librarians in the changing physical environment. 4-  Models or best practices of adjusting traditional library roles and services.  It is our intention to record the conference using videoconferencing software for review and possible distribution.  Two breakout sessions, each following the panel discussions will occur.  The information gathered from the conference will be used to write a white paper addressing the key issues that emerge, focusing on changes in both academic health sciences and hospital libraries."
1004125	200.0	EfTS Award- South Jersey Healthcare	DESCRIPTION: Requests for service to the Library have increased as our hospital has sought, and succeeded, in acheiving Magnet status. When we are charged for an article, it requires a multi-step process for payment, both on the part of the sending library, as well as on our part. Belonging to the EFTS will streamline this payment process, with the EFTS handling it for us. Statements of our account will be available on a daily basis, so that we can monitor our usage of the system.  This will save considerable time, and therefore, money. Let this serve as a letter of support for the grant that SJH is applying for to allow us to have access to funds for electronic transfer of payment for articles that we will access. SJH is actively using the library online access system to help us in our continual efforts to participate in evidence based nursing practice and medicine as well as actively pursuing research.
1004126	200.0	EFTS Award- Robert Morris University Library	DESCRIPTION: (1)  Meet with Dean of University Libraries and Head of Public Services to present in detail the concept of the Electronic Funds Transfer System (EFTS) in the context of Interlibrary Loan and document delivery services.  This presentation will include a brief review of the history and sponsorship of EFTS by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) and the University of Connecticut Health Center Library.  The benefits of participation in the 1200+ EFTS network will be explained in terms of improving Interlibrary Loan efficiencies through time savings, reduced invoice processing, fewer checks needing to be cut at a substanial internal cost, and more accurate record keeping.  Once the benfits, credibility, and cost-effectiveness have been presented to our library administrators, it will be embraced as a sustainable and sensible approach to handling payment of DOCLINE transactions. (2) Once EFTS has been successfully implemented at the RMU Library, other members of the library's professional staff will be given a similar presentation at one of our regular informational meetings. (3)  As part of the liaison responsibilities of the Health Sciences Librarian, faculty of the School of Nursing and Health Sciences will be updated on the utilization of EFTS through e-mail and possibly at a regularly scheduled faculty meeting. Support for establishing and sustaining a EFTS payment system for DOCLINE document delivery transactions has been pledged by both the Dean of Libraries (Fran Caplan) as well as the Head of Public Servcies (Christopher Devine) in several verbal communications with the Health Sciences/Interlibrary Loan Librarian.
1004132	200.0	EFTS Award- Saratoga Springs Public Library	"DESCRIPTION: Health information is a ""growth"" area in our library. The DOCLINE system facilitates the borrowing and lending of books and journal articles relating to current and complex health issues. The National Library of Medicine and other larger medical research institutions charge $11.00 per item. Participation in EFTS would allow sourcing of requests for books and articles to these reliable sources, and eliminate the need for using our library staff time for billing and payment. Most patrons looking for medical information to help them determine the best treatment want results quickly. Using Docline along with EFTS is a way of providing quality information as quickly as possible."
1004133	200.0	EFTS Award- Hamot Medical Center	DESCRIPTION: Being a small medical library , let administration know how important it is to improve the ease and cost-effectiveness of resource sharing throughout the region.  How important is is to join this program to insure continuing networking capabilities and to continue our sharing efforts.
1004134	500.0	EFTS Award- Penn State University College of Medicine	DESCRIPTION: The Harrell Library provides ILL services that charge back to the individual or department any related fees.  Despite efforts to obtain items through reciprocal arrangements and from free lenders, this is a hardship for our students (medical, graduate, nursing).  This award will allow us to provide ILL documents to students at a reduced cost and promote our services to this group of users; it may also determine if the current average cost of $11 is a barrier for this specific group's use of ILL services.  Observations from this process may demonstrate our need to adjust current practices regarding this user population.
1004135	500.0	EFTS Award- Western Pennsylvania Forbes Regional Campus Health Sciences	DESCRIPTION: We have spent over $250 on ILL's for FY08. Our yearly budget is $300 and in order to keep under budget, 14% of our FY08 ILLs had to go unfilled due to cost. Our ILL requests have gone up 37% in FY08 and will likely continue to increase in FY09. Our journal collection has been reduced due to lack of space for back issues and over all library budget cuts. A number of new physicians are coming from a larger hospital system that has a larger library with more resources than we have at Forbes Regional and it is difficult to keep them actively using the library if we continually tell them we cannot get the articles they are requesting.
1004136	200.0	EFTS Award- Trinitas Hospital	"DESCRIPTION: It would help us fulfill document requests we otherwise may deny due to budgetary restrictions. This funding would allow us some ""wiggle room"" and allow the library to offer more support ILL charge articles needed for patient care."
1004137	500.0	EFTS Award- Virtua Health - West Jersey Health Science Library	DESCRIPTION: Virtua Health has embraced the EFTS system and recognizes its benefits with regard to reduced costs and increased efficiency.  We anticipate the continued use of this system.  However, the librarians at Virtua are pursuing marketing efforts and to date have completed eight (8) presentations on library resources to the nursing staff at Virtua.  This is a previously underserved population here, and we anticipate that requests for our services will increase substantially.  We have already seen many more requests from the nursing staff in just the past two months.  As we continue our outreach program to the management and physicians at Virtua, we anticipate that requests for our services from those personnel will increase as well.  Though we are trying to increase services, the budget for the Virtua libraries has not been increased for many years.  We are currently facing cancellation of several information databases that were previously subsidized by the State of New Jersey which we will now have to purchase.  Unfortunately Virtua is being forced to try to â€œdo moreâ€ with less resources and may have to reduce the budget amount applicable to interlibrary loans.  We do not want to have to inform our patrons that they must either pay for an article or go without the information necessary for patient care.  An EFTS award stipend from the Middle Atlantic Region of the NN/LM would greatly assist in preservation of our resources.
1004138	200.0	EFTS Award- Jameson Health System Library	DESCRIPTION: This grant will give me the opportunity to the rationale and the necessity of the deposit account.  Right now, since I do not have EFTS, I am limited to only FreeShare articles.  he estimated unfilled requests is about 10 per year.
1004140	200.0	EFTS Award- St Francis Medical Library	DESCRIPTION: Usage would be the key factor.  Marketing the advantages of the resource sharing would be initiated.  Information can be put on  the Hospital Intranet and Physican newsletters.
1004141	200.0	EFTS Award- Holy Name Hospital	DESCRIPTION: I will explain to them that the Accounts Payable department will not have to cut dozens of individual checks every month for $11.00 each. It was once told by a colleague that their the average cost to process one check was about $110.00 for their Accounts Payable department. We borrow for cost, 8% of the time.  Which is approximately 4-6 every quarter.
1004142	500.0	EFTS Award- St. Mary Medical Center	DESCRIPTION: We use EFTS for ILL transactions on a weekly basis. I would estimate our EFTS costs for the past year at approximately $900.  Our usage has gone up very sharply over the past 1-2 years, as the Library has been increasingly promoted to physicians and staff, and with that have come many more search and ILL requests. The level of service we are able to provide our users (with just a solo librarian) is due in large part to Docline and EFTS. We have an excellent reputation for our short turnaround times even for challenging documents. With continued growth, we are having to spend much more on EFTS transactions than our budget will allow, taking away from our purchasing power for other resources. This award would support nearly 50% of our transactions in a year and allow us to allocate our funds toward other resources as we move to an increasingly online environment.
1004143	200.0	EFTS Award-The Commonwealth Medical College	DESCRIPTION: I will promote the EFTC grant to my administrators by introducing it as a transaction-based electronic billing system for interlibrary-loan (ILL) and document delivery.  The National Library of Medicine (NLM) the University of Connecticut Health Center (UCHC) EFTS staff are interested in expanding the system on a national basis to National Network of Libraries of Medicine (NN/LM) member libraries.  EFTS is a joint effort between the National Library of Medicine, the NN/LM, and the University of Connecticut Health Center/Lyman Maynard Stowe Library, which manages and maintains the system.  The EFTS is used by health sciences libraries for processing payment of inter-library loan transactions. It centralizes this activity by electronically billing participants, which greatly reduces the need to create invoices and to write checks for reimbursement for interlibrary loans and document delivery amongst participants.  EFTS virtually eliminates the need to create invoices and write cheques for reimbursement for interlibrary loans and document delivery between participants.  Other advantages of participation include monthly detailed transaction reports, the ability to handle charges for rush or fax service, the ability to vary charges to members of special groups, and the ability to handle non-DOCLINE transactions.

1004454	1000.0	Small Project Award: Listen and Learn	DESCRIPTION: Pioneering a powerful new form of online communications, podcasting for educators has become an effective way of interacting with students outside of the traditional classroom. Our medical and nursing programs need to provide a method for the students to have access to the most recent published articles.  They need access to Clinical Information that will assist them in treating patients. Podcasting has the capacity of advancing our student's and patron's education and gives them the tool necessary to better assist the primary attending in the delivery of patient care. This is an appropriate activity to the NN/LM outreach mission because our patrons will have another method to access our library resources.  This provides a very good source of direct communication with our target audience, who wants to receive our audio broadcasts automatically, without the need to access our website. Podcasts include information on health resources, literature and resource guides,!   navigating the library's new website, journal collection and evidence-based resources, UpToDate, as well as PubMed the Quick Way.  The medical library will purchase 5 iPod touch 8GB along with the protective Griffin Reveal Case. The iPods will be available at the circulation desk for patron use. The primary activity objective is to increase the visibility of our library. The second objective is to provide the most accurate, up to date clinical information. Our first step is to create a Podbean Account to upload our audio podcasts, such as Navigating the Library's New Website. Secondly, we will need to link our podcasts to the library's RSS feed. Thirdly, we will subscribe to a number of specialty journals, such as, the New England Journal of Medicine and the Journal of the American Medical Association, so that the podcast will be readily available to our patrons.

1004456	610.0	Small Project Award: If you display it, they will come	DESCRIPTION: The DSAMH Medical Library has a number of electronic resources available to its patrons, as well as a growing collection of books, periodicals, and multimedia.  We are also connected to academic, special, and public libraries throughout the state via our library catalog and can easily share materials via interlibrary loaning.  As the library gains more exposure throughout the state, it would be timely and relevant to pair the public library content available through transit services and the medical library books, journals, and resources, as well as ephemeral pamphlets obtained through federal agencies in an easy to access display.  Having a display of a conglomerate of information will introduce patrons to the many resources of the library, as well as increase exposure of information, relevant and appropriate to the NN/LM outreach mission.  This award funding would purchase a display to stand in the center of the Library's circulation area, as it will be visible and not impede traffic flow.  Funding would also purchase display stands for the uniform and orderly display of materials, to include books, multimedia, journals, etc.  This display would be ideal in incorporating easy-to-read content, quick facts, videos and media, as well as medical resources with co-occurring diagnosis treatment as the focus for the first quarter.  The display materials would be changed quarterly or as needed, based on patron needs.  For the first quarter, as there is a large number of patrons who seek information on co-occurring treatment options and therapies, materials focusing on co-occurring treatment would be displayed.  The second quarter could potentially have content about alternative treatment therapies that would be of interest to a large percentage of the patronage of the library.

An outreach campaign would target the following groups:  community physicians, rural health clinics, community support groups, El Dorado County public librarians, El Dorado County public health nurses, and El Dorado County Senior Services groups.  The Community Health Librarian would present the groups with information on the library's services, with demonstrations and offers of further training in MedlinePlus and other NLM/NIH databases.  The Express Outreach Award would further enable the library to replace three aging public desktop computers and thus ensure the provision of free access to MedlinePlus and other reliable health resources via the internet.  The library would purchase a laptop and LCD projector for outreach presentations (the CHL has none at present), and would also purchase Adobe Acrobat Standard software and a scanner, allowing scanning and FAXing of documents to other DOCLINE libraries and community health providers.

1004570	2505.0	Express Outreach Award 2008-09: Taking it to the Streets	DESCRIPTION: Sharp Healthcare sponsors one of the two Community Health Libraries in San Diego County. Attendance at community fairs has financial costs involved, but is worth the time and expense in order to disseminate both health information as well as how to access health information on their own, particularly medlineplus.gov.

The goal is to significantly extend the PCOM Library's community outreach services by working with more institutions to reach a broader base of users, and combine training expertise with cutting edge technology to offer new instructional options on how to search MedlinePlus, PubMed, ClinicalTrials, and other NLM systems. The Library will improve and expand the depth of existing website and digital resources searchable at multiple levels. The evaluation will measure project outcomes, value added services to improve information access, Web instructional approaches, and promotion of NLM resources. To be responsive to the next decade's upcoming Healthy People 2020 digital technology plans, the library is pursuing use of informatics, web technologies, and user-friendly interfaces for improved searching by all levels of users. This proposed project is essential because it builds on achievements from prior projects and can assure continuity of the library's community outreach services.

1004623	3950.0	Outreach Training: Crouse Hospital Library Partners with the VNA of CNY	DESCRIPTION: Currently, the VNY of CNY does not have a partnership affiliation with a medical library and so their registered nurses (who may enlist the help of physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech language pathologists, medical social workers, nutritionists, diabetes educators, and wound care specialists) do not benefit from the provision of medical library services and access to current health information resources supporting evidence-based practice, patient education, drug information, and continuing education. While there was great discussion and much interest in forming such a partnership in Spring, '09, the cost was determined to be prohibitive. With the Outreach Training Award, it would be possible to provide three years of library services and resources for this population of healthcare professionals and the clients they serve. This partnership between Crouse Hospital Library and the Visiting Nurse Association of Central New York would embody the spirit!   of the outreach mission of the NNLM in providing equitable access to biomedical information for all healthcare professionals and the population they serve.  Library services would include: research services by request conducted by trained librarian; online access to the Crouse Hospital Library web page at www.crouse.org/library including Mosby's Nursing Consult and Mosby's Nursing Index via Athens authentication; onsite access to Library in Marley Education Center with 13 public access PCs, wireless internet access, book and journal collections, and borrowing priviledges; document delivery services inclduing interlibrary loan for journal articles through membership in the national Network of Libraries of Medicine; and training by librarians on how to effectively use resources.

1004625	949.0	Small Project Award: Macintosh Support at Schaffer Library	DESCRIPTION: The goal is to provide support to AMC Mac users. Schaffer Library helps them as best we can, but by not having a physical computer, there is a limit to what we can do. The computer would also allow us to determine if an issue truly relates to the Mac, or if it is a broader non-Macintosh issue. Duplicating issues on the Mac and assisting Macintosh users with their computing needs will hopefully enable and encourage broader use of library resources by the AMC Macintosh community.  This activity would involve purchasing a 13-inch Macbook for use by librarians at Schaffer Library of Health Sciences. The machine would be used for testing, access to library resources, and troubleshooting customer issues.   After receiving grant money, steps include:  1.  Purchase computer from the (online) Apple Store for Education 2.

The workshop will be a combination of short lectures and hands-on computer demonstrations and practical exercises. It will be presented from within the context of a medical, clinical or pre-clinical perspective. The current vision is to provide three hours of computerbased instruction, two hours of guided networking and discussion, and a second three hour computerbased session. This is to allow ""decompression"" time between computer-based work sets while simultaneously providing an opportunity for participants to build relationships and discover opportunities for collaboration with others. The creator of the workshop will request six hours of continuing education credit to encourage participants to register. In addition, we propose here to develop the Fundamentals of Bioinformatics workshop under a Creative Commons license to promote redistribution and sharing of the material prevent, preventing commercialization of the workshop, and permitting the Creator to return copyright.. The exact conditions of how the Creative Commons License should be invoked needs to be negotiated to protect the interests and mission of the Mid-Atlantic Region of NN/LM as well as that of the Creator. An important component of this proposal is to lower the barriers for librarians to attend the workshops. We therefore are proposing to offer a minimum of ten librarian ""scholarships"" of up to $500 each to defray the cost of transportation and lodging for those librarians who are traveling at a distance and for whom their libraries may not be able to provide professional development funds. In particular, we are interested in creating as diverse a librarian population possible among the participants, particularly hospital librarians who will be given priority status for at least four of the scholarships, two/ each workshop given.

1004722	591.0	Small Project Award: Health Information Center Development	DESCRIPTION: Though we are keeping statistics of what information is requested by patients, and are ordering information accordingly, there are instances where we don't have the information on hand yet, or the request is so specific that there may not be a free or low cost publication available to us or on hand.  Once we decide that we don't have the information on hand, we begin research through reputable websites (ex. Medlineplus.gov, mayoclinic.com, amerciancancersociety.org, etc.), and will find the information, per the patients request.  If we can't fulfill the request at that time due to the time it would take to do a full research, we ask the patient the best way for them to receive information (email, U.S. mail, or pickup), which is completed in about 1-2 business days.  Since an additional computer would be used only for searches, and wouldn't have proprietary information on it, we can allow patients and guests to use the computer on their own.  To ensure that guests searching for health information on their own, use reputable and reliable websites for searching, we would instruct them which websites to use, based upon what they are searching for.  We would also make general, or non-condition specific, websites prominent to the user, by placing their icons on the computer's desktop, as well as stored in favorites.

1004727	30000.0	Outreach to Unaffiliated Health Professionals Award: Outreach to Institute for Family Health	DESCRIPTION: There are two primary activities that make up this grant.  The first activity is publisher negotiation.  The Health Sciences Library would approach our periodical publishers to negotiate a license addendum that would allow the IFH to have on-site access to all of our electronic periodicals through that publisher.  It is hoped that such access would be provided at a nominal fee, but that is an uncertainty to be addressed in the process.  Access to these services cannot add to Columbia Universityâ€™s FTE count or site count.  That is, any additional costs would be clearly identifiable as the costs for providing IFH access to these resources, and those costs would cease upon termination of the agreement.  The goal is that the agreement negotiated would be generic, so that any Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) would be able to take the same agreement and partner with a university in its service area to gain access to electronic health information res!  ources.  Negotiations would continue with additional publishers until either the grant funds or the grant period is exhausted.  The second activity is access to reference and education services.  Reference and Instruction librarians from the Health Sciences Library would be available to provide remote/virtual (email, phone, or chat, as appropriate) and on-site (at IFH) reference consultation and training.  In addition to training on the primary source materials provided through publisher agreements, training would also cover the vast array of free resources available from the NLM.  Reference and instruction services will be charged to the grant at an hourly rate. REMARKS: Michael  Koehn 212-305-9216 mdk2126@columbia.edu Outreach to Unaffiliated Health Professionals

1004795	10900.0	Gallup Indian Medical Center Grand Rounds	"DESCRIPTION: Our mission at Gallup Indian Medical Center (GIMC) is to provide quality and accessible health care to Native American beneficiaries of our area. An important tool that enables providers at GIMC to do this is access to culturally specific and medically relevant continuing medical education (CME). Unfortunately, funding for CME has been removed due to dwindling resources and expanding health care costs. Many health care providers at GIMC are concerned that the loss of these funds may affect their ability to stay current in their fields and continue to provide quality care to their patients. To address these concerns, we propose creating a monthly Grand Rounds that would be a source of free culturally and medically relevant CME for our providers. Addressing the lack of funding for CME at Gallup Indian Medical Center would help the library to achieve its long term goals by providing appropriate health care information to providers in the Four Corners area.   In 2005 the GIMC participated in the TC4C information needs assessment of health care providers. Respondents indicated as their top five diagnoses—diabetes, bone & joint, hypertension, eye disease and heart disease. 52.7% answered ""yes"" to difficulty finding culturally-appropriate materials for patient care.   As the largest Indian Health Service hospital in New Mexico serving the largest land-based tribe in the country, a partnership between the GIMC and the Health Sciences Library and Informatics Center (HSLIC) is a natural. In assisting GIMC with the Grand Rounds project, HSLIC will be helping providers in a medically-underserved region. In turn GIMC can be a source of information on native health issues and disparities.   The library will be facilitating the Grand Rounds series by allowing for the purchase of a new laptop for the presentations and training for the provider staff in finding health information. Future activities could include support for education and information support."

The technology  implementations are designed to supplement and extend current National Library of Medicine work in the area of health literacy by increasing the flexibility of BFCHI project outreach efforts, and by fostering improvement of prerequisite skills for health literacy, particularly in the area of basic computer and information literacy skills. Partner audiences cover a large geographic area of Illinois. Travel time and cost limits the opportunities we have to teach audiences.

1004832	12895.0	Express Outreach Award 2010: Checking the Pulse of Community Health: A Public Forum	DESCRIPTION: HARC was incorporated in 2006 by a collaboration of 30 community-based organizations that recognized the need for a regional health data collection system for individuals, agencies and institutions in Eastern Riverside County. They realized that without understanding the area's needs, solutions could not be formulated or efficiently implemented. Furthermore, they recognized that without health data, it was difficult to measure progress or to convey dire needs to current and potential supporters. HARC's mission is to provide objective, reliable research, analysis and technical services to Eastern Riverside County communities and to facilitate better decision-making regarding health and quality of life. HARC's three primary programs are: 1) a triennial health assessment and report for Eastern Riverside County and the Coachella Valley region; 2) survey and data-based services for community partners and other organizations; and 3) educational programs that help community organizations utilize health-related data. The triennial health assessment provides baseline data about the health needs and disparities facing the region's residents. The baseline data helps measure the impact of community efforts to address health issues, while providing a tool for strategic planning and business decisions that benefit the region. All program areas encourage community-wide, collaborative partnerships and resource pooling.

1004835	14776.0	Express Outreach Award 2010: Consumer Health Outreach in an Urban Underserved Area	DESCRIPTION: The purpose of the project is to actively promote the consumer health information services provided by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) in an urban underserved area. The National Library of Medicine provides valuable medical information for consumers through MedlinePlus, available in English and Spanish versions.  Incumbent to its success, however, is the awareness and utilization of these resources by various populations. As a Resource Library in the NN/LM, the University of Southern California's Norris Medical Library proposes to conduct an aggressive outreach campaign that focuses on the needs of specific user populations -- seniors, Spanish-speaking health consumers, and health professionals who primarily serve these communities in the East Los Angeles area.  This inner urban area includes a high proportion of Hispanic low-income residents, whose primary language is Spanish.  By actively promoting the benefits of MedlinePlus to these groups, we believe it will result in the following benefits: (1) increased knowledge of the availability of quality consumer health resources and improved access to these resources; (2) increased awareness by health professionals of high-quality and time-saving patient education materials available to aid them in communicating with their patients; and (3) the creation of informed health consumers who are empowered to be more active participants in their own health care.

1004986	34905.0	Development of an Open Source Research Process Assistance Template that Supports CTSA and Research I	DESCRIPTION: An open source, locally customizable research process template, MyRA, will be developed to outline the steps of research, and provide tools, needed forms, experts, resources and concepts that support each step. This tool will be built so that other institutions can easily plug local information into the template to provide the same central assistance to their institutions. Development and promotion of the online research support template should be achievable within 8 months, starting June 15, 2010. Researchers will have a one-stop-shop approach to understanding and identifying what research-related resources are at their disposal, what expertise is available to discuss their research, and what procedures need to be followed in order to meet research requirements. As the template is developed, it will be vetted through the MyRA Planning Team, the other two MCR CTSA institutions, and refinements will be made based on feedback received. The MyRA template will be shared via presentations at professional meetings and through a professional publication. Uptake by others of the MyRA template will be assessed through feedback from the national CTSA award institutions, NN/LM, MCR regional medical libraries and AAHSL association members.

1005116	8228.0	Express Digitization and Conservation Award - University of South Carolina	DESCRIPTION: The Charles S. Bryan History of Medicine Room at the University of South Carolina School of Medicine Library houses a 500+ volume collection of materials of great importance to medical, historical, and sociological research. The collection gives an indication of the kinds and numbers of medical books in the hands of physicians in South Carolina and reflects the education and training of doctors during the 18th and 19th centuries. Our initial project, funded by a NN/LM SE/A grant, of digitizing five titles from our rare book collection and development of a History of Medicine webpage was very successful. The learning and training from the first stage project prepared us to establish a scanning operation in the School of Medicine Library so that we could continue to make local collections available digitally. Our second project was the purchase and installation of scanning equipment and training staff and volunteers to digitize selected items from a small collection of approximately 50 items of medical ephemera, including pharmaceutical pamphlets, catalogs and various other medical papers from the late nineteenth century. 20 items were completed after the equipment was installed. Our planned project for our third digitization grant will be digitizing 18 additional items of pharmaceutical / medical ephemera. These items illustrate one of the early continuing education resources local physicians had to build their knowledge of new treatment options.

1005143	700.0	Express Library Technology Improvement - Orlando Health	DESCRIPTION: This project aims to integrate mobile information technology - an iPad - into existing Clinical Medical Librarian (CML) rounds to: 1) add real-time reference; 2) integrate library instruction for medical residents and interns and 3) test access and usability of a newly designed electronic library page on a mobile device. This project intends to utilize mobile technology to minimize the lag time of information provision during patient rounds and add value to the presence of the CML. Leveraging an ultra-portable tablet device will add immediacy to library information access at the point of care. Rather than utilizing the traditional CML model of returning to the library to do research, at least a portion of the literature searching and quick reference questions can be completed while rounding, and results can be emailed instantly to residents and attending physicians if requested. The opportunity for library instruction will be greatly enhanced by the iPad. Demonstrating ease of access and usability of library resources may help overcome the perceived barriers to accessing evidence; namely, lack of time and knowledge. It is an ideal situation to explain which resources are most appropriate for which type of questions. And since previous attempts to provide formalized instructions to residents have not met with success (due to scheduling issues), this is a long-awaited chance to show how to point and click (or tap and drag) to the best evidence-based information. Finally, based on feedback from a user needs survey, the library staff is in the process of creating an updated and streamlined version of the electronic library webpage.

1005399	10933.0	EOA 2012-13: Health Professionals Information Use in Patient Care in Research-Rich Settings	DESCRIPTION: The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Public Access Policy requires (since 2008) that all peer-reviewed journal publications resulting from NIH funding be made publicly accessible within a year of publication in PubMed Central (PMC). This Policy has the potential of translating into increased information use by the public, including health professionals. To assess the policy's potential and actual impact, benchmark measures of current health-professional use of this research in different settings are needed to see what happens when this research is and is not available to health professionals. As an initial step, this study investigates the information use of health professionals at Stanford University Medical Center (SUMC), who have relatively complete access to the biomedical literature, as well as popular point-of-care (POC) services, such as UpToDate. Stanford's robust collection will be used as a surrogate for the access to eventually result from the NIH policy, with the aim of establishing an understanding, through web log analysis and interview data, of the types of information used by health professionals and their knowledge of the Public Access Policy. This mixed methods approach will provide data to be synthesized, presented through hands-on trainings, and published to provide an evidence base for open-access policy makers, health science librarians, and health care practitioners to inform policy; to guide librarians' creation of information training, case studies, and collection development policies; and to raise awareness of the NIH Policy.

The project goals are to conduct mini-conferences that promote access to disaster and emergency preparedness health information, and increase awareness and use of the National Library of Medicine (NLM)'s Disaster Information Management Research Center (DIMRC)'s resources. The meetings will feature PHS emergency speakers and PCOM library instructors. They will provide cross training opportunities to benefit emergency public health responders, health professionals, librarians, and the public. Attendees will learn where and how to get quick access to online emergency health information resources, from mobile devices to WISER, MedlinePlus.gov, and other related sites during San Diego wildfires, earthquakes, blackouts, and hazardous disasters. The aim is to encourage partnerships among medical librarians, emergency responders, and health workers to share their expertise and resources for recovery planning with each other, and with local geographically dispersed organizations throughout SD County (e.g. churches, community centers, corporate and public libraries, and health practitioner groups). The PCOM library staff is experienced in conducting mini-conferences that combine speakers with subject expertise and information access training using the NLM resources.
1005401	11988.0	EOA 2012-13: Bridging the Health Information Gap: Saturday Academy & Charles Drew University Lib.	DESCRIPTION: The Saturday Science Academy II is one of the University's oldest pipeline programs. For years it has been strengthening the math, science, and health education of K-12 students through more involved instruction and demonstrations by local teachers, parents, and faculty members. Activities can range from students increasing their mathematic skills, to students wanting to become scientists or physicians because they now understand the scientific process and have been encouraged to dream. The program has been responsible for sparking the interest of numerous young people in careers involving science and medicine. The academy has three 8-week sessions and one 4-week session offered during the summer. Bridging the Health Information Gap will supplement these activities by providing training in using NLM resources to both instructors and students. The key tools that will be used are outlined in NLM SIS K-12 Science and Health Education website. Depending on the age group, NLM resources such as Tox Town, MedlinePlus, and the Visible Human Project would be introduced to the instructors of the Saturday Science Academy II in order for them to use these materials with their students. A librarian would be present during selected classroom sessions to conduct training for the teachers, monitor NLM resource use, and provide further instruction for interested teachers and students. At the conclusion of the project, all participants would be surveyed to gauge how effective our efforts had been in introducing NLM resources.
1005402	12000.0	EOA 2012-13: Integrating Patient-Centered Health Information into the Patient Centered Medical Home	DESCRIPTION: Savitt Medical Library will create a multifaceted mechanism to facilitate patients' use of information technology and encourage greater patient involvement in their own medical care. Building on the concept of the patient centered medical home (PCFM), the University of Nevada School of Medicine (UNSOM) has launched an innovative clinical facility for improving primary care for Nevadans. The UNSOM Patient Centered Family Medicine Clinic (PCFMC) model of care is designed to improve outcomes by organizing medical care around the patient and by focusing on education to enhance the ability of patients to actively understand and influence their health status. Within this clinical context, four specific aims will promote improved access to reliable consumer health education information and help patients engage in meaningful discussions with health care providers: (1) the creation of a patient education web portal integrated in the PCMH clinical environment; (2) provision of tablet devices in examining rooms for clinician and patient use; (3) creation of an online educational resource to guide patients in the creation and use of personal health records; and (4) participation of on-call librarians to provide mediated virtual support to assist patients in using health information resources.
1005403	12700.0	EOA 2012-13: Outreach to Students through College Health Services: Pacific Islanders Pilots	DESCRIPTION: College students are at a time in life when they are developing habits and decisions that affect the direction and quality of their lives. This project seeks to establish partnerships between college libraries and college health services for health outreach to Pacific Islander college students. The two entities are responsible for information (library) and health (student health services) resources and dissemination on a college campus. Personnel in both service areas would receive training on NLM resources. Working together they will develop strategies and activities to inform and prepare students to develop their health literacy and make healthy lifestyle decisions. Participating colleges include the University of Guam and one to three other colleges on Guam, American Samoa, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Republic of Palau (all two-year colleges). All these colleges have Pacific Islander populations with first generation student populations where English is not their first language. An anticipated barrier to health information outreach is the lack of health information in non-English languages. The project hopes to identify specific health topics that need to be developed or revised to address the needs of minority population students. This is a pilot project, so specific recommendations will be developed to promote the benefits of the partnerships and what further work can improve access to health information by college students and their families.

1005758	4994.0	Health Literacy Pilot Project Award 296 - Georgia Regents University	DESCRIPTION: Childhood obesity is at epidemic levels in the United States, with Georgia ranking second in the nation in childhood obesity. Young children who are exposed to unhealthy foods and are not provided with appropriate activity levels are likely to become overweight or obese. Children's food preferences and activity levels are established at a young age. In fact, some researchers suggest that children's food preferences begin developing in the womb. After birth, infants drink formula or breast milk for the first year. The challenge for parents and child care providers is, when the infant is ready for table foods, to introduce new foods that will be healthy and to provide children with plenty of tummy time and other floor activities. Many parents and child care providers do not understand that young children will frequently reject new foods because they naturally have a tendency toward sweet and salty foods and those same babies will fuss when put in the tummy time position. Many adults do not understand the importance of physical activity beginning in infancy and continuing throughout the childhood. Research shows that early intervention in the home and child care setting can help children to establish healthy eating and activity levels at a very young age. However, many people still do not understand proper nutrition or realize that their eating and/or activity habits may be unhealthy. Child Care Center workers at Georgia Regents University will gain improved nutrition and health literacy, to complement current wellness initiatives at the Center. Infants and children under their care, who represent a diverse group of nationalities and ethnicities, as well as the workers and the children's families, will benefit from additional understanding in establishing healthy eating and physical activity habits. NLM products and web sites will inform much of the training.

The study used DeafMD.org as a dissemination tool for educating the Deaf community, with participants claiming that the ASL accessible health videos found on DeafMD.org were an effective and welcomed method of health education. Our objectives include: (1) Create a new module about Cardiovascular Disease containing approximately 25 videos produced in ASL which cover the causes, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of the following topics. Each topic will include four to five videos: Coronary Heart Disease High Blood Pressure Heart Attack High Cholesterol Cerebrovascular Accidents (Stroke) (2) Achieve a combined utilization rate of least 5,000 unique video-views per month, on DeafMD.org, for these specific videos. This will be achieved through internal promotions on the DeafMD.org website and social media platforms, and collaborative marketing efforts with NN/LM and other partners. We hope that the NN/LM will include our videos in its online database of ASL videos. (3) Create new and effective linkages between DeafMD.org and the NN/LM and leverage these linkages to reach more individuals in the Deaf community.

1010124	9000.0	EOA 2014-2015: Patient Engagement with MYSFHealth, San Francisco's Patient Portal	DESCRIPTION: Patients will access their health information through MYSFHealth, SFHN's online patient portal. We estimate that well over 100,000 patients receive care from SFHN providers. For the first time with MYSFHealth, all these patients will have the opportunity to access their health information online.  There are many challenges to overcome to ensure that patients both access and understand their health information: many of our patients are economically disadvantaged, struggle with chronic health conditions, and have low health and digital literacy. The SFGH Library will build on its existing partnerships with the San Francisco Public Library, UCSF Center for Vulnerable Populations, and SFHN providers, health educators, and administrators to develop, promote and deliver a program to help patients access and understand their information within MYSFHealth. We will also work with the SFGH Associate Chief Medical Informatics Officer to integrate MYSFHealth with MedlinePlus Content using MedlinePlus Connect. The SFGH Library staff plans to develop a program to help engage patients with MYSFHealth. We will work with patients and providers to develop a modular curriculum, office hours, and outreach efforts to teach basic basic computer skills, email, MedlinePlus, finding reliable health information online, and MYSFHealth. This curriculum will be adapted from curriculum previously developed as a part of the Digital Empowerment for Diabetic Patients project which was also funded NN/LM PSR. Specific details of the project plan can be found in following sections. The SFGH Library plans to continue this patient engagement work after the award period. REMARKS: In 2014, the San Francisco Department of Public Health will integrate and rebrand its healthcare delivery system - a network of hospitals and community clinics which includes San Francisco General Hospital.  This new delivery system - the San Francisco Health Network (SFHN) - will make it much easier for providers to triage their patients and for patients to transition from different providers within the network. A key part of this effort is to consolidate patient health information into a unified, centralized repository which both providers and patients can access through separate interfaces.

1010158	4100.0	Hospital Library: Past, Present, & Future of Blessing Health System Visually Presented	DESCRIPTION: Blessing Hospital is building its first patient care addition since 1970, scheduled to open in January 2015. A new hospital lobby will hold permanent wall features celebrating the community and the health system. The library has been asked to lead this project and will work with the Blessing Foundation, Public Relations Department, senior hospital management, and community leaders. The purpose of the wall feature is to engage the health care consumer with the hospital's past, present and future by using text, pictures, and objects. We have many accomplishments to highlight as Blessing Hospital opened in 1875, and will celebrate its 140th anniversary in 2015. The library's main responsibilities in this project are research and digitization. Our small library staff is fully engaged in supporting the research initiatives of our Magnet hospital, leaving little time for a new hospital-wide project. We need supplemental support staff, some additional equipment, and software to complete this exciting new assignment. An added benefit will be the preservation of and access to materials previously only available in print. Everything digitized will be provided metadata and be uploaded into an online finding aid for future research and updates to the lobby wall feature.

1010167	445.0	Professional Development: WMLA 2014, Nesvig	"DESCRIPTION: Attend Washington Medical Librarians Assn Meeting, Ellensburg WA 2014.  Awardee statement: The annual WMLA conference will be the only library conference (so far) I've attended two years in a row. At last year's conference, I enjoyed the smaller size compared to many conferences and collaborative discussions between presenters and attendees. This year's theme of ""Harnessing the Data Whirlwind"" ties almost perfectly into a discovery I made at Bastyr last year. A collaborative discussion about visualizing data led me to explore the software program Tableau desktop, which led to me using it at work to better visualize service desk data, which led to a happier and better informed boss! I've also recommended Tableau to several other students/librarians. While I don't know exactly what I will discover at this year's conference, I do know that it will change my work for the better. Plus, a LibGuides panel discussion? I use LibGuides regularly and can't wait! REMARKS: As the outgoing WMLA iSchool liaison, I have spent the past almost two years communicating with iSchool students about WMLA activities. I am active on all social media connected to the iSchool and local librarianship. I would be happy to present my conference experience in a variety of ways, from a traditional email or social media post, to a short online video to a blog post on Dragonfly. I would also employ listservs to further share this info. I believe more librarians and information professionals should know about the work that WMLA is doing and I think the momentum of our conference the past two years has us well poised for that."
1010168	1725.0	Professional Development: Quint Chapter Meeting 2014, Whitmore	DESCRIPTION: Attend 2014 Quint MLA Chapter Meeting in Denver, CO. Awardee statement: As a solo librarian, I don't get too many opportunities to network with other medical librarians from the region. One of those few opportunities is the annual PNC/MLA meetings. With money being tight due to attending graduate school, I thought the meeting this year would be beyond my ability to attend. With this scholarship though, I could attend very easily. It allows me interact with other professional librarians and attend CEs that I wouldn't get to attend otherwise. The interaction and the CEs in return help me to decide how to best run my medical library and help to keep me update on new ideas and innovations is library management. In addition, this one of the few venues where I can interact with vendors and see what is up and coming for the library community that will ultimately enhance the service I provide.

1010177	4500.0	Premier Health Quality and Safety Knowledge Management/Knowledge Services Librarians Workshop	DESCRIPTION: The Knowledge Management/Knowledge Services initiative at Premier Health System will set the stage for lifelong learning for those involved. Quality and safety are Premier Health's highest priority. Information and knowledge in the healthcare environment is unavoidably tied to evidence based health care, patient safety, patient privacy, health literacy and knowledge sharing. The librarians in the Premier Health System are committed to being involved in and providing support for the quality and safety initiatives that high reliability organizations need for success in caring for our patients. The three tenents of knowledge management; technology, people and processes are factors hospital librarians have been competent in even before Knowledge Management became known. As the rapid changes in new technologies and techniques for information processing and dissemination are available, health sciences librarians have led the charge in providing accessibility and support. This wide ranging support makes resources available to health care professionals, students, researchers, educators and even patients. Because Hospital librarians understand the principles and practices related to providing information services (or knowledge services) to meet user needs, by participation in providing this workshop to executives at Premier Health, the five librarians in the Premier Health System will contribute to and, in some areas lead, the processes of making knowledge that has value available and link Knowledge Management and Knowledge Services to the organizational strategy. These efforts will enhance and support the development of an organizational environment where knowledge sharing becomes systemic. REMARKS: HLA002

1010269	1500.0	Professional Development: Evid-Based Practice Institute, Beardsley	"DESCRIPTION: This award allows the awardee librarian at Bastyr University to attend Systematic Review Workshop: The Nuts and Bolts for Librarians. Awardee statement: Bastyr University is on the frontline of integrative, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) research, as demonstrated through our history of NIH grant awards, commitment to clinical research and our researchers, and our goal-oriented approach to expanding the evidence-base for natural medicine (http://www.bastyr.edu/research).  Due to long-standing funding issues and other challenges, research in the CAM fields lags behind that of conventional medicine.  The current emphasis on patient-oriented outcomes, in tandem with new approaches to studying CAM, are refocusing attention on the need for high quality pragmatic trials and, especially, systematic reviews.   Librarians working collaboratively with researchers and clinicians on systematic reviews will nourish the next wave of research relating to natural medicine, especially and specifically at Bastyr University.  In the past three years Library Director Jane Saxton has co-authored a Cochrane Review, the gold standard for systematic reviews, with a team of Bastyr and Canadian researchers that included Dr. Gordon Guyatt, originator of the term ""evidence-based medicine.""  A summary of the study can be found here:  http://summaries.cochrane.org/CD006095/the-use-of-probiotics-to-prevent-c.-difficile-diarrhea-associated-with-antibiotic-use   Another systematic review, efficacy of whole system naturopathic medicine, on which J. Saxton is co-author, is undergoing the peer-review process at PLoS One."

1010287	14997.0	Target Outreach: Nursing Experts: Translating the evidence (NExT)	DESCRIPTION: This project focus of the Nursing Experts: Translating the evidence (NEXT) project is Minority Health Professionals/Minority Populations. This project will promote awareness of and access to resources from the National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health among public health nurses (PHNs) serving throughout the state of Illinois. Many public health nurses work in small, local public health departments that are unaffiliated with large academic institutions or hospitals. The NEXT project will educate these unaffiliated public health nurses on the high quality, free government resources available from the National Library of Medicine and other agencies and teach them how to translate the evidence that they find in these resources into their daily practice in order to better serve their communities. A study of public health nurses identified a need for resources that are easy to navigate and well organized for their specific needs. The NEXT project will provide a source for easy access to PHN resources, CE opportunities, and self-guided learning through an online library guide available to all public health nurses. Through the Library of the Health Sciences Outreach Committee, the NEXT project will have institutional support for its long term sustainability. By educating public health nurses in the NLM/NIH resources available and how to translate the evidence from those resources into practice, the NEXT project will impact the health of our communities.

1010290	9210.0	Target Outreach Subcontract: Developing Data Knowledge for Health Sciences Lib	DESCRIPTION: We propose to build on the results of a previous target outreach subcontract in which we gained an understanding of ethnographic methods used at the University of Rochester Libraries and their applicability to health sciences libraries. We now propose a low-cost, seven-institution study of how third-year medical students seek and use information in the course of daily activities, especially activities conducted in a clinical setting. Third-year students typically rotate through different clinical specialties and types of clinics, exploring their practice options and beginning the process of selecting the post-doctoral specialty. We will ask 12 of these students at each of the seven institutions to mark their movements on a map for one full day, specifying that this be a day on which they spend at least part of their time in a clinical setting. On the day following the mapping day, we will interview each student, asking him or her to narrate the day, paying special attention to those times when information was sought or used. We will record and transcribe each interview and then analyze the interviews to develop a picture of what third-year medical students need to do in order to find and use information when they are in a clinical setting. We will further investigate how students make use of various information sources, platforms, media, devices and finding aids - including but not limited to libraries and library personnel - to meet those needs. We propose to conduct the project during 2013 and 2014; each institution will provide in-kind contributions to augment the grant funds we seek. Project findings will provide insight for future review on how and how well the library is meeting the current needs of these fledging practitioners and what additional resources and services are needed to support a clinician's health practice. The findings will also help participating institutions identify emerging needs that the library has not traditionally met... REMARKS: SUB619
1010291	9210.0	Target Project Award: Developing Data Knowledge for Health Sciences Lib	"DESCRIPTION: The collection, management, and use of data, in all formats and in all disciplines, are increasing. As it increases, it is critical that librarians understand how researchers are using it and what role the library may, or may not have, in its collection, management and use. To address this need, the Library has organized the 3rd biennial Kathleen A. Zar Symposium entitled ""Data: Collecting, Using, Managing."" This proposal requests funding to live webcast and videotape the Symposium in order to reach a wider audience than will be able to attend the actual event. In addition, we are proposing to develop a half-day workshop prior to the Symposium that focuses on collection, management and use of statistics specific to health sciences libraries that will provide participants with hands-on experience using data. The Zar Symposium will provide participants with an understanding of how data is used in real world applications, as well as examples of collaborative efforts between institutions, groups or individuals specific to collection, use, access, preservation and overall management of data. Although there have been many webinars and conferences to talk about data at a broad level, there have been very few that provide a more focused perspective giving examples of real world data projects and hands on learning surrounding data. The videotaping of the Symposium will allow it to be made available online for future viewing as well."
1010293	500.0	Exhibit: Dental Village Outreach Project	DESCRIPTION: The Hilltop Healthy Kids & Family Carnival brings together community partners once a year to promote healthy lifestyle changes to at- risk urban youth and families in the Hilltop community of Tacoma, Washington.  Tacoma is a designated empowerment zone of Washington State because of its high crime, poverty and school dropout rates.  The focus of the carnival is to promote 4 simple pillars of health to children and their families which include: dental/medical health, nutrition, fitness and mind/emotional health.  Since 2010 this has been an annual event at the People's Community Center after Schools Program which usually attracts 300 plus children/families.  Our goal in February 2014 is to celebrate National Children's Dental Health Month, National Heart Health Month, Black History Month and healthy life style changes through our custom designed t-shirt, booth games, juice bar, food bank and public service announcements. At the registration booth, a carnival passport book is issued to each child/ adult attending the event requiring them to visit each booth where they will play a game, participate in an activity and/ or receive health information to earn a stamp. Free custom designed carnival t- shirts are given to participants that turn in stamped passport books. The dental booth activity to earn a stamp for participants will be to observe or directly learn how to use MedllinePlus to research a dental topic via laptop or smartphone. Also participants will be given MedlinePlus handout material. Dr. Jones is the chair of this event and also the mistress of ceremony.

The portal is focused on delivering trustworthy health and wellness information to our residents with a local focus.  Since launching in spring 20II, the health portal has outgrown its original, custom­ content management system (CMS) design and would be better served by an Open Source platform (OSS) that is dynamic, technically relevant, and responsive to how people use information today. This project will redesign the East Brunswick Public Library's ""Just for the Health of It"" community-wide health portal into a flexible, open source platform that would allow librarians to easily maintain and update the site, adding content in a much more timely fashion.

DESCRIPTION: This project will provide means for Community Health Network (CHNw) medical staff who attend Continuing Medical Education (CME) programs sponsored by CHNw to become active participants in their learning through the use of an audience response system (ARS). Presenters will use the ARS to give pre- and post-assessments of knowledge of the CME topic; pose questions throughout the presentation that can stimulate discussion among the attendees and provide the presenter with an opportunity to clarify points of confusion in his presentation. The attendees of the program will be able to assess their retention of key points in the presentations and take part in discussions of questions posed by the presenter. Several key components will be measured: 1. Pre- and post-event assessments of knowledge gained - this will be the first time learning has been measured in this way for CHNw-sponsored CME programs.

1011637	9000.0	EOA 2015-2016: EnviRN - Evidence:  Enhancing nurses' capacity to search for environmental health evidence	DESCRIPTION: The Institute of Medicine notes that all nurses should integrate environmental health into their education, practice, research, and policy efforts, yet environmental health is poorly incorporated into nursing curriculum1. Thus, new nurses are ill prepared to assess and address environmental health problems. With this project we will create a self-paced, problem-based tutorial for nurses -faculty, nursing students, and practicing nurses - about the relationship between environmental exposures and health outcomes and the location of reliable informational and data sources that are part of TOXNET®.  The training will include an introduction to environmental health for nurses, introductions to select TOXNET® resources, and 4 environmental health case studies to illustrate how TOXNET® can be used in education, practice, and research. The training program will include instructions to faculty who may want to use this training for curricular purposes, instructions for practicing nurses on how they can use TOXNET® resources to help determine the risks associated with their patients' and communities' environmental exposures (home, work, school, community), and instructions for nurse researchers on the TOXNET®'s unique informational resources.  The proposed training will incorporate case studies will include one on children's exposures, one involving women during pregnancy, one involving a rural community's population-based exposure, and one illustrating the environmental justice implications of asthma.  The project will be developed in collaboration with librarians serving nurses at the USF, the PSR RML, NLM TOXNET® staff, and USF faculty experts, in partnership with Education Committee members of the international Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments (www.enviRN.org  ).

1011688	1500.0	Youth Mental Health Outreach (Library Partnership with Sevier County School District)	DESCRIPTION: Since January 2015, Richfield Public Library has partnered with the six-county Prevention Coalition, including Sevier County School District (Gail Albrecht), Central Utah Counseling Center (Sharon Lopez), Central Utah Health Department (Sue Hildebrand), the Indian Dormitories (Cody Workman), the Central Utah Youth Corrections (John Roberts) to support efforts to reduce drug abuse, domestic and dating violence, and suicide rates in our area.  The Library recently received a grant from NIFI (National Issues Forum Institute) to support purchase print and media materials to help engage the public in dialogues on reducing the stigma of mental Illness and enhancing personal resiliency among youth.  Outreach programs to Central Utah Youth Corrections (Juvenile Detention) and to selected schools in Sevier County have been ongoing for more than four months, and will be continued and expanded.   Library Director Blythe Ogilvie has made use of many of the NLM resources in planning outreach programs including materials on youth mental health, suicide prevention, and helping teens with substance abuse and depression.  In addition, the Library has purchased journal articles through NLM to support the school district's prevention efforts.  The $1500 grant will be used to purchase a portable LCD projector and screen, in order to provide additional outreach to larger youth and community audiences.  Instead of gathering a group around one computer or a laptop, we will be able to take the projector and screen into the dormitories and CUYC for programs.  We also plan to provide outdoor programs for youth during the summer reading initiative (which reaches K-8 youth from the Sevier County Schools), using NLM resources and programming ideas.  The portable projector and screen will enable us to have a greater impact and reach a wider audience with exciting media available both through NLM and other sources.

Teachers will leave the symposium with resource materials, curriculum alignment and ideas for organizing notebooks/projects/lab books, and college contacts and materials to be able to offer career counseling to their students. More rigorous alignment of coursework between secondary and post-secondary curriculum will continue through ongoing communication; technology ideas will be brought back to their respective schools for future implementation."
1011700	9590.0	Technology Improvement: Bilingual Patient Education	DESCRIPTION: The project goal is to provide the tools necessary for the Cascade Medical Clinic physicians and mid-level providers to create personalized libraries of patient education materials to meet the unique needs of their individual patient panels. These libraries will be stored on mobile tablets assigned to each provider and consist of access to professional video education available in both Spanish and English on over 150 health topics. In addition, the medical providers will be trained to access internet sources of patient education materials and store them on the mobile tablet for quick retrieval during a patient visit. Currently, providers at Cascade Medical are limited to printed handouts for patient education. These handouts are generally provided at the end of the patient visit to be taken home and reviewed. While this might be suitable for a small portion of the population, most patients would benefit from education in a technological format that is more engaging and can be delivered during a clinic visit allowing for an opportunity for question and answer with the provider. The use of mobile tablets and access to professional video patient education made available during clinic visits will increase exposure to educational materials for patients and may translate into improved understanding of medical conditions and compliance with recommended courses of treatment.
1011701	10892.0	Technology Improvement: Expanding Educational Opportunities	DESCRIPTION: The Northwest Regional Primary Care Association (NWRPCA) will improve educational capabilities in both face-to-face settings and distance learning modalities by 1) replacing or upgrading outdated presentation equipment used by speakers at our Primary Care Conferences and seminars, and 2) purchasing advanced distance learning software to expand our growing catalog of online courses. NWRPCA offers education and training for community health centers (CHCs) within HRSA Region X (Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington). This includes 101 NWRPCA members, of which 81 are health centers representing over 500 individual sites, as well as non-affiliated CHCs within the four-state region. In 2012, Northwest Region CHCs served by NWRPCA provided health care to some 1.3 million people, most living at or below the poverty line. To effectively meet the needs of the populations in their care, CHC staff must have access to continuing education in best practices, improved techniques, and changes to law or policy.

These programs have expanded and built upon each other and used partnerships and connections that have grown over the years. The need for educational opportunities persists, however, according to a 2012 report in which the University of Michigan found that approximately 64% of public health RNs agreed that ""they would like more opportunities for training and professional development.""8 The NExT project continued our long tradition of enhancing professional practice by educating public health nurses on where to find free and reliable government resources, how to successfully use them for their specific information needs, and how to translate the information into practice. Preliminary data from the NExT project indicates that 87% of participants would like additional educational opportunities from the NExT team.7 In the second phase of this project, the NExT team has four objectives: 1) provide onsite instructional sessions with Continuing Education Units (CEUs) for practicing public health nurses, 2) create a NexT mobile app, 3) create a social media presence connecting public health nurses and librarians, and 4) promote the online materials, social media presence, and mobile app to increase awareness and use. Without interruption, UIC has continued its support of the materials created since 2001 and will continue to support both the online NExT portal at http://phnext.uic.edu and the NExT mobile app. REMARKS: SUB626"

1012618	1000.0	Professional Development: Access for All in Emergency Preparedness and Response	"DESCRIPTION: Funding will support the ""Access for All in Emergency Preparedness and Response"" training session offered at the 2015 WASCLA Language Access Summit to be held October 16-17, 2015 in Ellensburg, WA. WASCLA Language Access Summit will bring in a national expert on emergency management services for immigrant and refugee populations in order to offer training to the maximum number of our constituents. Currently emergency management services for limited English proficient (LEP) persons in Washington are being handled on a largely ad-hoc basis outside of King County, if at all. This critical issue has been highlighted most recently in the wake of Summer 2015 wildfires in Eastern Washington, which have occurred in certain counties with large numbers of Spanish-speaking residents, many of whom have LEP. In accordance with WASCLA's mission to promote language access solutions through collaborative efforts, we believe it will be beneficial to share the example of a systematic, coordinated approach to emergency management from another state, in this case a program operating in Minnesota."

1012620	11280.0	Target Project: 2016 Great Lakes Science Boot Camp Planning	DESCRIPTION: Building on the success of the initial Great Lakes Science Boot Camp, a team of several libraries and library organizations are planning to hold another Great Lakes Science Boot Camp in Summer 2016 at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana. Modeled after other science boot camps in New England and the American West and Southeast, this program will bring together STEM librarians and give them an opportunity to network and get introduced to STEM research produced at institutions in the Great Lakes region. Since many STEM librarians have little or no background in the sciences this program can help them better see how researchers use libraries and why they need the information they request. This 2.5-day Boot Camp will consist of four half-day sessions on areas of STEM research such as nanotechnology, the development of cancer treatments, biomedical engineering, and flow physics. These sessions will be led by prominent faculty members who will give general overviews of the emerging trends and research methodologies in their fields of study as well as a description of their own research projects. Other Boot Camp programming will include a keynote speaker, evening social events to encourage networking, and tours of research facilities. By attending this Boot Camp, librarians from the Greater Midwest region will enhance their understanding of several key areas of STEM research and will be better prepared to support the research and research data management at their home institutions.

1012735	4220.0	Tech Improvement: Supporting Medical Students in Rural Clinical Rotations	DESCRIPTION: Effective July 2015, the National Shelf Exams, for medical students, changed from paper examinations to online testing.  The West AHEC Medical Librarian proctors national shelf examinations.  West AHEC is the designated regional testing site for medical students from multiple universities; mainly the University of Louisville and the University of Kentucky. We need health care professionals in rural areas.  Therefore, as part of their clinical education, students are encouraged/required, to complete clinical rotations in rural Kentucky. However, the University of Kentucky and the University of Louisville are approximately 200-350 miles from the Madisonville/Paducah area. It is not feasible for the medical student to return to their university for testing after completing each 4-8 week clinical rotation. Additionally, being housed in a hospital setting brings a multitude of electronic/Internet issues; firewalls and a slow guest network, are just a few.  In order to be compliant with the National Board of Medical Examiners regulations, internet speed, access and a quiet testing area are crucial.  Our proposed project is to convert existing conference rooms into functional, on demand, computer labs.  The Technology Improvement Award would accomplish this goal and educate students about National Library of Medicine resources; PubMed Central, MedlinePlus and additional commercial resources.

1012858	3800.0	Libraries as Lifeboats: Communities in Crisis	DESCRIPTION: The idea behind this proposal is to pay-forward the information and inspiration  received at the Pathways to Normalcy pre-conference session at the NYLA annual conference in October, while adding an element of fun and skill-building for the 42 member libraries (and four counties) of the Pioneer Library System in New York State and their municipal emergency response partners.  The proposal includes a half-day workshop with Dan Wilson, Coordinator of the NN/LM Disaster Ready Initiative and presenter at the NYLA Conference.  This session would include information on libraries' internal disaster preparedness (i.e. disaster plans) and how libraries can partner with their municipalities to support and participate in a community-wide disaster response.  We are also inviting Kevin Niedermaier, the Director of the Office of Emergency Management for Livingston County, to provide the municipal perspective.  The afternoon session gets participants up out of their seats with the Go Games Disaster Preparedness Games, an interactive experience designed to prepare the library and municipal personnel  for potential disasters while fostering teamwork and trust in the group.  These libraries and municipalities often work together, especially in times of crisis, so both the instructional workshop and the unique team-building portions will make the member libraries better partners for their communities.

1012938	15000.0	MOU: Public Health Information Access Project, Washington State OY4	DESCRIPTION: The Public Health Digital Library, a project of the Lamar Soutter Library (NN/LM New England Region, University of Massachusetts Medical School) aims to cost-effectively provide full-text resources to public health departments nationwide. Beginning in FY 2010, the Digital Library project recruited Public Health Departments in Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, Colorado, and Connecticut to host a customized Digital Library Page offering department staff desktop access to licensed resources made available through specialized pricing. This aspect of the Digital Library project is called the Public Health Information Access Project (PHIA). PHIA includes a training component with instructors drawn from NN/LM NER and the Lamar Soutter Library. NN/LM regional Resource Libraries agreed to provide public health workers with article delivery for those items not accessible through the Digital Library. The Expanded Public Health Information Access Project, known as PHIA-E, extends the geographic scope and duration of the initial Digital Library effort. Three additional states - Kentucky, Arkansas and Wisconsin - joined the project during the NN/LM contract Base Year and Option Year 1. During Option Year 2, Indiana, Maryland, Hawaii and Alaska began to participate. Library staff at the NN/LM regional Resource Libraries in these states assisted with the training and agreed to provide article delivery for those items not accessible through the Digital Library. In addition, resources were reviewed and some added when requested by the participating public health department workers. This agreement provides funds from the National Network of Libraries of Medicine, Pacific Northwest Region (NN/LM PNR) for services of the Lamar Soutter Library and project consultant Karen Dahlen, to add Washington State Department of Health to the Digital Library project (PHIA-E) during Option Years 2, 3 and 4, ensuring access to the Digital Library for the duration.

1013603	14850.0	Outreach to Consumers to Improve Health Literacy	DESCRIPTION: Through interactive training workshops, we will assist a diverse group of community members in learning about their health conditions, understanding how to research health information using NLM and other internet resources, and learning how to prepare for a medical appointment including compiling a list of questions for their health care provider.  Faculty from the Albany Medical College (AMC) Schaffer Library of Health Sciences (SLHS) and the Division of Community Outreach and Medical Education (DivCOME) will utilize their experience in health literacy, community outreach, and health education to achieve these outcomes.  We will rely on existing partnerships with community based organizations to target our workshops and reach high-risk community members including previously incarcerated individuals, people with low income levels, minorities, older adults, and people living in rural communities.
1013604	15000.0	The Healthy Pet Project	DESCRIPTION: The Healthy Pet Project (HPP) is a wonderful opportunity to educate our community participants in the skills needed to promote healthier lifestyles for their pets, themselves, and in the differences and similarities between pet and human health concerns. Most of our workshop participants are not aware of MedlinePlus for humans let alone its pet health section. Since MedlinePlus provides easy to use, reliable information in both areas, MedlinePlus information and training will be incorporated into the program. In addition, we are able to address our participants' concerns for their pets with regard to disaster preparedness. Of course, disaster preparedness for our animal companions also parallels preparedness for ourselves and the information we provide covers both. The Healthy Pet Project is being sponsored by a diverse group including an academic health sciences library, public libraries, the Veterinary Medical Center of CNY, the Priscilla Mahar Animal Welfare Foundation and the Central New York Library Resources Council. Our program reaches out to a diversity of audiences including: K-12; senior; underserved and minority populations; the members of our local libraries including those of our program partners; children receiving care at the Golisano Children's Hospital, UPSTATE Cancer Center and students and clinicians at Upstate Medical University. Participation in the workshops is not limited to our program partners. The availability of the Healthy Pet Project workshops is promoted through the HPP webpage (under development), social media outlets and at community events such as the Canine Carnival so individuals and interested organizations are informed about how to schedule a workshop in their community. The workshops are offered without fee during the award period. If fully funded, we anticipate offering sixteen workshops (2 per month) and reaching over 200 community members.
1013605	15000.0	Health Information on the Go: Reaching Rural Populations by Bookmobile	DESCRIPTION: The Columbia County Traveling Library is working toward doing more community outreach in partnership with area agencies. We hope to outfit our new bookmobile as a mobile classroom that would help us provide outreach and education for the rural populations we serve, which experience significant health and economic disparities. We already reach more than 500 regular patrons at 49 bookmobile stops. We plan to engage them at this point of contact by offering semi-formal tablet-based trainings on how to use tablets and how to access quality online health information. A tablet-lending program will increase digital literacy as part of this initiative. These encounters will develop interest in formal health information literacy training on the mobile classroom as a part of a community health fair, which would include nutrition and fitness training offered by community partners. Our goals are to create awareness about MedlinePlus and other quality consumer health information resources, increase their use, and connect people to local resources and services which will improve health and quality of life.
1013606	15000.0	Pennsylvania Older Adult Medical Resource Information Initiative	DESCRIPTION: A $15,000 National Network of Libraries of Medicine grant will allow the Pennsylvania Behavioral Health and Aging Coalition to research, coordinate, develop, and implement the Pennsylvania's Older Adult Medical Resource Information Initiative through the course of the eight month funding period. The staff of PBHAC will use the National Network of Library of Medicine resources and staff support to identify methods of incorporating information about NN/LM resources into PBHAC's three established programs - Behavioral Health Connection trainings, Behavioral Health Training Services, and Cross System Collaborative Technical Assistance Calls/Technical Assistance Calls. In the execution of the Pennsylvania Older Adult Medical Resource Information Initiative the Board and Administration of PBHAC expects that a minimum of 6,000 Pennsylvania older adults, their caregivers and loved ones; and professional medical, behavioral health, mental health, drug and alcohol, and social services staff will be provided with information about how to access National Network of Library of Medicine resources.
1013607	14995.0	Harnessing the Power of Public Library and Other Staff to Improve Population Health	DESCRIPTION: This four-module pilot curriculum provides the necessary tools for library staff to recognize the health and social challenges facing their most vulnerable patrons, engage with those patrons, and subsequently refer them to appropriate community-based resources. Over the next eight months of this project, we seek to modifythe pilot curriculum and deliver it to staff working in various capacities at the CHLC (training site 1), including individuals working in the library, pediatric and adult clinics, and the recreation center. Because of the co-location of services, CHLC staff are well-positioned to collaborate and make reciprocal referrals, something the training program will facilitate.Furthermore, we will supplement our current training modules with NLM resources, providing participating staff members with resources that will help increase their personal knowledge of these important issues (and which they may also wish to refer patrons to). We will then repeat the trainings, with any appropriate modifications, in West Philadelphia (training site 2),another area identified by the Free Library of Philadelphia as a next strategic location for health initiatives.
1013608	4999.0	Bringing Rigor and Reproducibility to Research	DESCRIPTION: Reproducibility is one of the main principles of research. Rigor in the design of the research is another.

1013609	15000.0	Developing a Health Literacy Curriculum for Osteopathic Medicine Students (DO/HL)	DESCRIPTION: The need for healthcare professionals to recognize low health literacy patients and to communicate with them effectively has been well recognized and widely reported. The Touro College of Osteopathic Medicine is a fully accredited four year school of medicine leading to the granting of the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree (DO). We offer a comprehensive educational program that prepares our graduates to enter residencies throughout the country and to become licensed physicians in the 50 states and District of Columbia. Our evidence and experience demonstrates that more than 50% of our graduates become primary care physicians. In this role, they are in a position to have major impact on health and disease outcomes. The introduction and continued emphasis and reinforcement of health literacy across the curriculum will prepare and educate more primary care physicians who are better able to communicate with their patients. It will also a test a curriculum template for other medical schools to use in integrating health literacy into their own curricula. This grant application is for funding to acquire resources to support the review and revision of the current curriculum of the Touro College of Osteopathic Medicine to include health literacy issues, concepts or skills in appropriate pre-clinical courses required of first and second year Osteopathic Medicine students.
1013610	15000.0	Promoting Health Literacy by Training Front-Line Staff in a Hospital Setting	DESCRIPTION: Wilkes-Barre General Hospital (WBGH) is located in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, which has consistently ranked poorly in national health statistics. The county is higher than average in the age of the population, unemployment, poverty, and other indicators of a population at risk. WBGH is the largest hospital in the area and has a huge impact on the health of the community, especially on the population living in the inner city area where literacy rates are the lowest and poverty is the highest. Through observation and informal questioning it was found that the staff lacks knowledge of the concept of health literacy and its issues. The Patient Education Committee has determined a more systematic approach is needed by staff in providing health information to our patients and community. This project and grant request will fund part of a more comprehensive program. It will be used to increase knowledge of health literacy among the health professionals on staff through training and provide access to additional materials to support health literacy training and patient/consumer health, resource awareness, and the Teach-Back method. Coincidentally and separate from this grant proposal, a FMEA committee was established to do a gap analysis at Wilkes-Barre General Hospital focusing on health literacy. The FMEA committee will develop an internal plan based on its findings. Their findings will be available sometime during the grant period and will serve as a blueprint for possible additional health literacy projects within the hospital.
1013611	11665.0	Using BLE Technology to Communicate Information and Promote Information Literacy to Health Professionals	DESCRIPTION: The CMSRU Library supports the medical education needs of a new and growing medical school, the high-level clinical needs of our associated academic medical center, Cooper University Hospital, and the needs of the fifteen graduate medical education programs offered at Cooper. The library presently uses traditional technologies, such as email and website/Blackboard announcements to support the curriculum and provide outreach services. CMSRU wants to harness handheld devices, using Bluetooth light environment (BLE) technology, to communicate inside and outside library walls while providing access to resources and services at the point of need. This proposal describes how the CMSRU library intends to utilize BLE technology to provide outreach services and critical information.

1013642	23721.0	MSEARCH (Mobile Systems Education and Resources for Consumer Health) 2	DESCRIPTION: Mobile Systems Education and Resources for Consumer Health (MSEARCH) 2 is an electronic skill-building program focused on educating seniors in Harris County how to navigate National Library of Medicine (NLM) health information resources using mobile device technology. The program will address the information-seeking needs of seniors while providing ready access to NLM e-health information resources. This program is an expansion of the MSEARCH program that was developed and successfully implemented by the Greater Houston Area Health Education Center (GHAHEC) at four community centers last year. Because of the program, approximately 80 seniors learned basic mobile tablet device skills and were introduced to the NIHSeniorHealth and Medlines Plus websites the MSEARCH 2 program will be carried out using a similar methodology. The target population will be reached at three centralized senior centers throughout Houston, Harris County. The program curriculum will incorporate lessons covering Medline Plus, the NIHSeniorHealth and Go4Life websites. We will teach the curriculum to approximately fifteen seniors and at least one staff member at each location. For optimal results, we will collaborate with Neighborhood Center Inc. to access the target population. The agency will support the project by providing classroom space and wireless Internet access at each of its affiliated senior centers to attract participants throughout the Houston area. GHAHEC will purchase 30 mobile tablet devices to accommodate the learning needs of older adults. In addition, upon program graduation, each training location will receive on desktop computer to set-up for public Internet access. It is our desire to motivate participation in the program and empower seniors to take a more active role in their healthcare.
1013643	24999.0	Promoviendo la Salud: A Guide to Spanish Language Health Education Resources	DESCRIPTION: The National Center for Farmworker Health proposes to develop a one stop health education website and training guide designed to increase the awareness and utilization of Spanish language Medline Plus, NCFH health education tools, and other patient education health resources by targeted staff at Community/Migrant Health Centers.

1013644	25000.0	Meeting the Community Information Needs Regarding Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccinations	DESCRIPTION: The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) three-shot vaccine series is the only current method to prevent future HPV persistent infection-associated cancers. In July 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released data showing that almost 39,000 HPV-associated cancers were diagnosed in the United States each year between 2008-2012 (1). This data represents an approximate increase of 12,000 more cases of HPV-associated cancers each year than data released in 2012 (2). Of the annual HPV-associated cancers, over 28,000 that are due to HPV strains could be prevented by the use of one of the three possible three shot vaccination series approved by the Food and Drug Administration. A recent study conducted in our community showed a significant lack of knowledge on how HPV was spread and the HPV-associated cancers. The study confirmed there are misconceptions that surround HPV vaccination.  In addition, it is not well known among physicians or the community that males age 9-26 have the option to be vaccinated against HPV with a three-shot series. The goal of this project is to prepare educational materials at the appropriate third-grade reading level for our community (which also may be utilized nationwide) and to provide a focused educational forum that will give healthcare providers the tools they need to have conversations about the HPV three-shot vaccine series. It is hoped through these educational endeavors that the vaccination rate at University Health Shreveport (UH) will improve for both males and females.
1013661	14000.0	EOA 2016-17: Community Access to Health Information Training in San Diego	DESCRIPTION: The Pacific College of Oriental College (PCOM) proposes a collaborative health information outreach project to increase awareness and access of NLM/NIH online resources by providing training workshops for consumers and health professionals in San Diego. The goal is to extend access to health care information through training workshops for all residents, with emphasis on reaching multicultural, diverse and minority populations at their communities, and to improve the library's technologies needed to conduct the project. The partners include eight organizations consisting of PCOM College and affiliated clinics, SD County, SD City and Chula Vista public libraries, LJ senior community center, the LGBT center, and Prince Chapel AME church.  The PCOM library will provide free instructional workshops on access to NLM's MedlinePlus, PubMed, Clinical trials, and more on several medical topics using multiple technologies including laptops. iPads, and smartphones.  Based on community assessment discussions with partnering sites and county population data, the target groups will be consumers, nurses and health practitioners of varying ages and ethnicity.  Plans are to conduct 16 to 20 workshops for 700 to 800 attendees in San Diego multi-ethnic neighborhoods. Live sessions will be offered in Spanish, Chinese, and searches of multiple languages as needed. The PCOM librarian, the health information instructor, and staff conducting the project are highly experienced.
1013663	13999.0	EOA 2016-17: Community Health Information Resource for Seniors (CHIRS)	DESCRIPTION: The overall purpose of the Community Health Information Resource for Seniors (CHIRS) is to strengthen and enhance Washoe County's provision of resources to its community by building a comprehensive, easy to navigate web-enabled compendium that consolidates all the scattered information that supports the needs of the aging population. CHIRS will deliver a program of instruction, both in-class and online, to demonstrate and promote the benefits of the website and illustrate the variety of beneficial online health information resources. Classes will also include a discussion of mobile technologies and apps in the context of senior self-care and well-being. Sustainability of the project will be addressed by recruitment of students fulfilling service learning curricular requirements. By focusing on access to local services and online information resources, we hope to improve the capacity of older adults to locate and integrate information that fosters a healthier and more self-reliant lifestyle. REMARKS: Nevada has one of the highest rates of growth of seniors in the nation, echoed in the Washoe County NV demographic profile. Seniors currently make up approximately 14% (58,216) of the total population. The next 10 years will see an increase of approximately 32%, making the elder population the fastest growing segment in Washoe County. Although agencies strive at local and federal levels to connect seniors to available community services and online information, no centralized compendium is in place to help them navigate the primary care and social support systems and corresponding information resources.

1013837	4996.0	Health Information Outreach Award 43	DESCRIPTION: The University of Florida (UF) Health Science Center Libraries' (HSCL) Health Information Outreach project will bring health information resources & literacy skills training to librarians, community organizations, and members of the public throughout Alachua County. Using the mobile outreach kit, the project team will equip librarians and other community educators to teach their users about health information resources, and to understand the challenges those with limited health literacy face in understanding health information, regardless of their location or available facilities. Based on evidence from an information needs assessment, the customized curriculum will include training participants how to find and use validated health information resources, such as MedlinePlus, both on and offline. Participants at these trainings will learn how to critically evaluate health information resources, as well as how to teach their users to do so. The curriculum will also cover topics in health literacy, such as understanding the impact of limited literacy on health care outcomes, recognizing the signs of limited health literacy in a user, and developing strategies to provide resources and education for these users. The goal of this project is to improve the public's access to reliable health information resources by empowering librarians and community educators to provide their users with the best evidence in health research, enabling them to make informed decisions about their health.
1013844	10000.0	Cancer Conversation: Saving lives through early cancer detection	DESCRIPTION: 15-40 Connection and the National Network of Libraries of Medicine both work to provide access to vital health information to improve quality of life and the healthcare experience. To close the gap in delayed diagnosis of cancer and provide the lifesaving advantage of early cancer detection, individuals need to be empowered through an integrated approach to health education that drives behavior change. 15-40 Connection is teaching audiences in high schools, universities, hospitals and corporations how to use personal health awareness to detect cancer earlier and improve cancer survival rates for everyone. A critical element of this education is continuity, reinforcement and access to reliable information and advice. Our partnership with NN/LM will provide ongoing access to credible resources for reliable and up-to-date information to further empower patients with guidance regarding doctor/patient relationships, symptoms, confidentiality and patient's rights.
1013846	12558.0	CoughEtiquette 2016-2017	"DESCRIPTION: We will continue supporting our education program with previous participants who wish to continue. However, we are shifting our strategy to move into public spaces and reach people of all ages to expand the awareness of the importance of proper coughing and sneezing etiquette. Dense, highly traveled areas where public are required to be for purposes such as transportation, judicial hearings, and attendance at public zoos and other areas, are the focus of this year's campaign to educate and encourage proper sneezing and coughing etiquette. In anticipation of rapidly increasing public awareness of the CoughSpot program, we are building implicit flexibility to add latecomers who wish to join our movement.  	Highlights of this year's program are the inclusion of courthouses (and their libraries), continuation of participation at the largest pediatric hospital, as well as the children's museum, and the state airport. These should increase awareness significantly. We are anticipating exponential growth of the program."
1013847	4677.0	Health Information Outreach Award 45	"DESCRIPTION: In cooperation with the Georgia War Veterans Nursing Home in Augusta, Georgia, the ""Assessing the Health Information Seeking Behaviors and Needs of Nurses in Skilled Nursing Facilities"" project will assess the information seeking practices as well as information and educational needs of nurses working in the long-term care environment with frail elderly patients. Assessments will be performed utilizing both questionnaires and observations of the nurses on the floor in the care facility across all three shifts. The findings of the assessments will inform the development of an online toolkit for the nurses to consult which will include resources such as MedlinePlus, NLM Drug information, PubMed, and other relevant content, depending on the findings. The toolkit will be loaded onto desktop computers placed at the nurses' stations at the Georgia War Veterans Nursing Home to facilitate easy access for the nursing staff. A second phase of this project (to be funded separately) will be to develop a training program for the nurses, and potentially other facility staff, surrounding use of resources included in the toolkit."
1013848	4939.0	Technology Improvement Award 46	"DESCRIPTION: This project proposes the use of funds to cover the costs associated with hiring a trained website designer to enhance the design and navigation of a publically available website that provides access to free and open access resources for unaffiliated public health and primary care providers. The ""Common Wealth of Public Health and Primary Care Information"" website has been actively maintained by VCU Libraries since 2010. Minimal website design changes have occurred to the website since a 2011 platform migration to LibGuides 2.0. Feedback from recently completed focus groups with potential website users, uncovered many design flaws and potential areas for improvement. The project team proposes working with a VCU Libraries web designer to incorporate design and navigation changes based on the collected and reviewed feedback. Usability testing, approved under a VCU IRB renewal, of the new design, facilitated by the web designer and project team will also be useful in ensuring the site's new design is appropriate for the target audience. Feedback on the new site design will be sought from a previously established website Advisory Committee, comprised of representatives from community health organizations and VCU departments focused on public health and primary care. Funds for this project will be used to secure the domain name and URL for the website for an additional three years. National Library of Medicine (NLM) resources such as PubMed, DailyMed, the NCBI Bookshelf, and ToxNet are already highlighted on the site. Information about NLM Services such as LoansomeDoc and MedlinePlus are also described. Because the target audience is unaffiliated with a library or hospital, providing access to freely available resources and reduced cost document delivery services are important. Improving site design and navigation will enable more use of these services by the target audience."
1013849	4950.0	Medical Library Project Award 47	DESCRIPTION: GA-PCOM opened in 2005 with only one program (Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine [DO]), 75 students, and eight faculty. The Information Commons, which houses the library, computer labs, and study space, had two employees, a library manager and a library assistant. Eleven years later, the number of programs has increased to four (DO, Doctor of Pharmacy [PharmD], Master of Science in Biomedical Sciences [MS], and Physician Assistant Program [PA]); a Physical Therapy (PT) program is planned to begin in approximately two years. The number of students has increased by 1,410% to 1,133 and the number of faculty have increased by 787.5% to 71. Library staff have increased from two to six people with an assistant director, systems and emerging technologies librarian, educational resources librarian, library specialist, and two library assistants; an information technology services (ITS) employee also has an office in the Information Commons. Despite this growth, the Information Commons space has remained the same size, with some renovations made to increase the number of study carrels and tables. Library staff space was decreased by almost half to create four additional study rooms for student use. No space planning has been completed to reevaluate how the Information Commons should be reconfigured for optimal student, faculty, and library staff use. For this reason, it is essential that a needs assessment be completed to determine how the space can be utilized to increase student and faculty use and have appropriate space for library staff. Libraries, and in this case the entire Information Commons, must ensure that students and faculty want to use the space and seek the services of library staff. Designing a space meant for collaboration and interprofessional education in mind will help drive this use; Incorporating student and faculty preferences into space planning and when deciding what technology is needed within the Information Commons is key to ensuring use of space.
1013851	4985.0	Health Information Outreach Award 48	DESCRIPTION: The Community Health Education Center (CHEC) is a library for patients and their family members located in a large academic medical center. CHEC provides patients and their family members with reliable health information written at a level they can understand. In addition to providing patients with health information,   The CHEC librarian plans to provide a day-long consumer health information symposium aimed at local public librarians. Public librarians often serve patrons requesting health information. The symposium will provide an overview of CHEC resources. Health sciences librarians will provide training sessions focusing on evaluating online resources, providing consumer health reference services (reference interview and ethics of working with patients), finding consumer health information online including low-literacy resources and resources written in other languages. The symposium will include a tour of CHEC the Massey Cancer Center's Linen Powell library.  This symposium will facilitate a sense of community among participants. Often consumer health librarianship can be isolating due to a lack of other consumer health librarians nearby. This program will allow attendees to become acquainted with the CHEC librarian and other VCU Libraries librarians who can provide expertise to support local librarians tasked with answering health-related consumer questions. Likewise, this program will facilitate meeting other like-minded librarians interested in consumer health resources.   Overall, this project contributes to the mission of the National Network of Libraries of Medicine by providing public librarians with the skills and knowledge to provide consumer health information services to diverse populations. The patient population requesting services at the public libraries will have access to reliable, consumer health information from which they can read, understand and use to make informed decisions about their own or a loved one's health.

1013862	4784.0	Health Information Outreach Award 65	DESCRIPTION: Federal mandates as well as standards outlined by the Joint Commission regarding the provision of adequate care to Limited English Proficiency (LEP) patients require that University of Virginia (UVA) clinicians be informed about information resources that will be helpful to this population. MedlinePlus, MedlinePlus in Spanish, and the website, Health Information in Multiple Languages, can provide patients and clinicians access to quality online health information. Hospital interpreters are also essential to the provision of quality care to LEP patients. Interpreters are available at the University of Virginia Health System, either in person or through an interpreter system provided by CyraCom. In-person interpreters are not available for most languages so clinicians use the dual-handset phone supplied by CyraCom. Recently, the new CyraCom Interpreter App has been made available for Android and iOS devices and a pilot project initiating the use of the app on an iPad in a University of Virginia Children's Hospital department has led to increased interpreter use and clinician satisfaction with LEP patient interactions. There are seven individual units serving women, infants, and children at UVA hospital in the Children's Medical Center (CMC) or the Women's Place units whose patients or families may have Limited English proficiency. This project would increase the ability of clinicians in these departments to use this app for video face-to-face interpreting and promote use of this tool. We hypothesize that increased use of the app and quality information sources will improve clinician understanding of health literacy issues and satisfaction when interacting with LEP patients
1013865	5000.0	Portable Health Information Kiosk	DESCRIPTION: The primary goal of this project is to assist in the delivery of improved health information to the residents of Martha's Vineyard, focusing primarily on seniors and their caregivers.

This kiosk will be transported off site for programs provided at Island Senior Centers, other Island libraries and other program sites.  This touch screen kiosk will provide information in English and Brazilian Portuguese from vetted medical databases on such topical health issues as addiction, nutrition, diet and exercise, cancer, mental illness, alcoholism, dementia, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and tick-borne diseases.  This project will serve as a beta testing site for the introduction of a health information kiosk at the Martha's Vineyard Hospital.
1013866	10000.0	Leveraging Libraries as Hubs for Spontaneous Volunteers, Just-in-Time Training Guide On Utilizing the National Libraries of Medicine Resources	DESCRIPTION: Post-disaster community members seek opportunities to volunteer and support recovery efforts. Tapping into this resource requires governments to have a plan to receive, train, and equip spontaneous volunteers rapidly. Libraries are known community hubs, provide great space for processing and training volunteers, and have access to resources related to disasters through the National Libraries of Medicine among other sources. Nashua Office of Emergency Management will use grant funds to establish spontaneous volunteer reception center hubs utilizing libraries and librarians and developing a guide on how to best utilize the Disaster Information Management Research Center and the Wireless Information System for Emergency Responders to build just-in-time training on health and safety post disaster.
1013867	8693.0	Eureka Research Fair	DESCRIPTION: Girls Inc. of Worcester plans to offer an 8-session program for 20 high-school girls enrolled in Eureka  ̶   a 5-year program that involves at-risk girls in planned activities and education that increases their opportunity for success in STEM education and careers.   This program will take place from November 2016 through February 2017, and will complement and enhance the Eureka curriculum.  Each year, girls participate in Eureka for 4 weeks during the summer (160 hours) followed by monthly meetings and workshops during the school year (30 hours).  The program helps participants see themselves as an important part of the future workforce by providing an intensive, educational 4-week summer program and guided opportunities for increased knowledge and skill-building during the school year.  Currently the Eureka components include topics such as architecture, physics, engineering, individual and team sports, computers and forensics, kinesiology, video game design, animal metamorphosis, optics and rocket science.  Eureka also includes Core Essential Services by providing programming that falls under three categories of Healthy Living, Academic Enrichment, and Life Skills.  This proposed additional component will focus on the girls' health issues that affect their community through resources such as PubMed and Medline Plus.  Participants will also learn to safely navigate the Internet and identify information from reputable sources, as well as use JoVE (The Journal of Visualized Experiments) to learn specific laboratory techniques. To fulfill this component of the program, Girls Inc. will need both access to the Internet and a subscription to JoVE.  A 2015 Community Engagement Award enabled Girls Inc. staff and 18 Eureka participants in grade 11 (from Eureka Cohort 1) in the use of PubMed and Medline by UMass staff.  Girls Inc. proposes that an additional 20 Eureka participants receive that training this year.  Those 20 students would each choose an applicable
1013868	14000.0	Empathy Learned Through an Extended Medical Education Virtual Reality Project	"DESCRIPTION: It is particularly important that innovative learning modalities are utilized to augment our University of New England College of Osteopathic Medicine (UNECOM) medical students' learning about empathy in relation to older adult health care. Currently those age 65 years and older use more than 50% of health care resources. As the older population increases and lives longer, their health care utilization is predicted to increase dramatically, therefore placing an obligation on our health care providers to work with older adults within primary care as well as any medical specialty. We plan to utilize a virtual reality (VR) experience for 1st year medical students. Specifically, we will incorporate the ""We Are Alfred"" software developed by Embodied Labs, a company that creates immersive, interactive, VR experiences for health training. ""We Are Alfred"" uses a VR headset, headphones, and a hand-tracking device to immerse users in the story of a 74-year-old patient, the titular Alfred. The virtual experience will immerse each UNECOM 1st year medical student into a hypothetical patient's life, thus imparting knowledge to the medical students about aging, dignity, and the importance of making meaningful connections in order to thrive. VR kits will be available at University of New England (UNE) Library Services, and 1st year medical students will access the equipment from the circulation desk with a student ID and complete an assignment associated with geriatrics training as part of the geriatrics curriculum. Students will be introduced to information resources available from the National Library of Medicine (NLM) related to older adults' health, geared to providers, patients, and their families. A pre/post assessment will aid in assessing students' experiences including changes in attitude and knowledge."

1013886	3995.0	Tech Improve: Enhancing User Experience: Providing a Visual Browser for Electronic Journal	DESCRIPTION: The mission of Blessing Health Professions Library is to enhance learning, research, and patient care by effectively managing knowledge-based resources for the 21st century.  This mission is accomplished with respect for our patrons through dedication to excellence, creative service approaches, and by providing a doorway to information access through new technology initiatives.  This application encompasses two areas of our mission: creative service approaches and information access through technology initiatives.  The library will purchase licensing of the BrowZine product for the use of Blessing Health System including Blessing-Rieman College of Nursing & Health Sciences.  This award would allow the library to enhance learning and patient care utilizing new technology initiatives at Blessing Health System.  With the increasing transition to electronic-only journal holdings and full text databases, the ability to browse journals has become more difficult.  BrowZine is a service that makes scholarly journals available in a visual, browseable format through the web or a mobile device.   Patrons can browse and read e-journals by subject and view complete issues of journals, including the table of contents.  The patron can create their own bookshelf and be notified when new issues are published.  Articles can be saved for off-line reading and export them to other web services.  This system would improve on the services provided by the library and increase awareness of the electronic journals that the library subscribes to.
1013887	9984.0	Express Outreach: Health Information Outreach to Homeless Patients at the HOPE Recuperative Care Center	DESCRIPTION: The  Oakland University William Beaumont  School of  Medicine  (OUWB)  will  collaborate  with  the HOPE  Hospitality  &  Warming  Center in  Pontiac,  Michigan  to  empower  discharged  homeless  patients  in  its  Recuperative  Care  Center  with  better  health  information  seeking  and  literacy  skills.  Launched  in  2015,  the  HOPE  Recuperative  Care Center  is  the  only  place in Michigan  that  offers  medically  supervised  shelter  to  patients  discharged from  area hospitals  with  conditions  that  would  be  exacerbated  by  living  on  the  street,  in  traditional  shelters, or  other  unsuitable  places.  The  recuperative  model  generally  has  demonstrated  significant  health  improvements  in  both  the  health  of  clients  and cost  savings  to  health  systems  by  interrupting  high  recidivism.  An  additional  aspect  of  both  of  these  goals,  however,  entails  educating  homeless  clients  about  their  health  conditions  and  management  strategies,  as  well  as  appropriate  care  seeking  g  (e.g.  when  to  go  to  the  emergency  department  versus  waiting  for  a  primary  care  appointment).  The  aim  of  the  proposed  outreach  project  is  to  expand  HOPE's  capacity  to  help  homeless  persons  recover  from  an  acute  illness,  surgery,  or  injury  in  its  Recuperative  Care  Center  b connecting homeless  clients  with  NLM  and  other  related  health  information  resources  on  medical  or  mental  health  issues  of  most  concern  to  the  homeless  patients.

1013905	6792.0	Using tablet computers to teach newly-diagnosed diabetes patients about medication administration and diabetes self-care.	DESCRIPTION: Managing diabetes is a full-time job for patients.  They must adhere to medication regimens, monitor glucose levels, adopt new diets and make smart life-style decisions to avoid disease complications and maintain a good quality of life. Tablet computers, through their multimedia capabilities, interactive features, and touch screen functionality can enhance learning across patient populations. Tablet computers can also act as an APRN extender for patient education.  Tablets offer better consistency and quality control of the educational message while also overcoming literacy and language barriers. Tablet computers can also fill downtime during the office visit enabling patients to be productive while they wait for the results of their bloodwork.  With this grant, UConn Health would purchase 4 Samsung Galaxy (Tab A) tablet computers, 1 wireless printer, and 1 ReadyDock UV (RD5) machine for use in the hospital's outpatient diabetes education program. The tablet computers would enhance patient education on medication administration, glucose monitoring, equipment selection, diet, and diabetes self-care.  The ReadyDock UV machine would provide on-site disinfection between patient users, and would also enable charging and secure storage of the tablets. The wireless printer would enable patients to print handouts to bring home with them for further review.

1013907	9700.0	See One, Do One, Teach One	DESCRIPTION: The One Button Studio (OBS) is a simple video recording studio can be easily used by a novice to create polished video content such as oral histories, interviews, presentations, and instructional videos.  The OBS is in itself a learning experience, and an opportunity for sharing and creating information and knowledge. The MMC Library seeks to establish an OBS in one of our library meeting rooms. This project will be in partnership with several departments and initiatives at MMC and will be a perfect realization of MMC Library and Knowledge Services' vision statement: Connecting You with Knowledge to Learn, Share and Create.
1013908	5054.0	Using Assistive Technology to Foster Independence	DESCRIPTION: This technology funding proposal is to obtain assistive technology for use in five Life Skills classrooms at Roosevelt Elementary School in Worcester, MA. Roosevelt Elementary houses three life skills classrooms grades kindergarten through six and two Autism/Life Skills classrooms grades kindergarten through six. This technology will be used daily in the Life Skills classrooms, servicing a total of 36 students. This proposal requests funds to purchase Ipads for students use, Bluetooth switches to access the technology, ipad bumper covers and Ipad apps. Using the Ipads and various NLM resources such as ToxMystery and other resources listed on the children's page website of MedlinePlus.gov https://medlineplus.gov/childrenspage.html the non-verbal students will be able to increase independence with communication using a Proloquo2Go app and students with physical disabilities will be able to demonstrate their knowledge of cause-effect apps. Daily interactive apps will transform the students into active learners, thereby increasing their independence and academic achievement despite health and medical disabilities. Data will be taken weekly to track amount of time independently using cause/effect apps or independently requested items using a communication app. Evaluation of data will determine if student independence using assistive technology for communication or cause/effect achievement increases by 10%.
1013909	10000.0	Reducing Health Disparities among VIPs and Other Minority Groups	DESCRIPTION: It is often said that if you want to be healthy, choose your parents wisely. We know that persons with disabilities, or as we prefer, persons who are differently abled, come in all forms and sizes, with many different conditions.  We also know that at some point in our lives, we will be differently abled as well.  Since we can't choose our parents, we must rely on the choices that are available to us. This project is a collaboration between different population groups, between different health care providers, between the medical community and the lay community, between differently abled persons and their caretakers present and future, with whom we choose to engage to make a difference in our health.  This project is not about finding a way to navigate through a labyrinth, but a way of joining together several labyrinths and creating a path as a team, to improve the health and well-being of all members of the team. The need for reducing health disparities is well documented, and for purposes of this project we are limiting our scope to those persons who are differently abled, beginning with VIPs (Visually Impaired Persons).  Our approach is multi-pronged, by finding and connecting networks of people who have common interests, whether or not they are aware of the other networks.  Lions Clubs International, for example, does an excellent job of raising funds for eye research, but by and large the clubs are disconnected from the population group they intend to help. Through various initiatives we have, and will continue, to bring groups together to reduce and eliminate social, physical and logistical barriers.  VIPs have met and interacted with sighted volunteers, with cultural organizations, with government officials and lawmakers, and with medical professionals.  This project will expand these interactions to include transportation companies (MBTA, Uber), media companies (Audio Journal, WCCA-TV), non-profit organizations (Lions Club International and others)

Sencer Museum's exhibition ""Health Is a Human Right: Race and Place in America"". The exhibit has been secured as a permanent gift from the CDC museum to GSU and is in storage in a large classroom at the School of Public Health. Our goal is not to recreate the exhibition, but rather to use the exhibit materials and classroom as an interdisciplinary teaching tool that will be meaningful and relevant to students across all disciplines and lead to discussion and student research projects based on the content of the exhibition. The exhibit consists of over 200 poster-board mounted images, documents, and narrative commentary with sections on Racism, Immigration, Poverty, Environment, Health Care, and Housing. GSU faculty members from the University Library, School of Public Health, African-American Studies, the School of Nursing and Health Professions and others, will prepare rotating exhibits focused on health disparities, social determinants, and other challenges over the last 120 years that have impacted health equity in the U.S..  The Health Sciences Librarian will provide QR codes linked to relevant NLM resources (e.g. ToxNet, American Indian Health, DailyMed, HealthReach, AIDSource, PubMed, etc.) as well as handouts with PMIDs for additional student research. The librarian will also create an online, open access Omeka exhibit catalog.

1014047	50000.0	Health Literacy Collaborations: Addressing the Health Information Needs of Organizations Serving Adults with Low Health Literacy and Limited English Proficiency	DESCRIPTION: The Plain Language for Health (PL4H) workshop is designed to increase consumer access to health information and services by training health information specialists, educators, librarians and others to use plain language writing and design principles in health information materials and websites. The first PL4H workshop, offered March 18 - 19, 2016 by Tufts University School of Medicine, trained 40 participants and attracted professionals from a wide range of community-based organizations serving adults with low health literacy and limited English proficiency. The proposed project aims to increase our training capacity from 40 to 100 participants and add a new health literacy collaborations component that links librarians with community-based organizations serving low health literacy and limited English proficiency adults, with a focus on adult education programs serving new immigrants and refugees.  The new collaborations component will prepare 12 - 24 librarians as health literacy facilitrainers. Prior to the PL4H workshop, facilitrainers will participate in a full-day session to improve plain language writing & design, materials assessment for collection development, and plain language oral presentation skills (i.e. avoiding jargon, checking for understanding) for delivery of consumer health information training's. Facilitrainers will attend the PL4H workshop and work with participants from community-based organizations to discuss community needs and pilot their plain language consumer health information training's. Following the workshop, facilitrainers will visit community-based organizations and offer plain language consumer health information training's to support the health information needs of undeserved communities.

1014066	12500.0	Bridging Health Information Gaps at the Public Library	"DESCRIPTION: Access to reliable health information for vulnerable populations: Vulnerable populations often reflect diversity from a number of perspectives. Diversity is frequently defined by social and demographic characteristics such as age, gender, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. As PPL considers those segments of our patron and user base who are most vulnerable, we believe this initiative can serve the needs of Portland's teen population, homeless population, and the Immigrant/refugee segments of our community.  Health literacy: As an organization that seeks to ""be the civic and cultural center of a dynamic region in which citizens are literate, informed, and engaged,"" PPL has placed high organizational value on supporting our patrons and users as they build their health literacy. Health literacy is the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. Because this literacy is dependent on both individual and systemic factors, this project seeks to give individuals practical, easy-to-access tools to build their own health literacy and also to build and strengthen the Library's partnerships with other local resources to ensure a continued high level of attention to the health needs of these particular population groups.  Making patrons better-informed patients: Patients should be involved in making decisions about their own health care. We use the term ""informed shared decision making"" to describe decisions that are shared by doctor and patient and informed by best evidence, not only about risks and benefits but also a patient's specific characteristics and values. This project will contribute to this dynamic by educating patients so they can exercise these health-related rights and duties more effectively."
1014067	10000.0	HPV Education: a varied approach	DESCRIPTION: Team Maureen has been educating a wide variety of audiences about the connection between HPV and cancer since our inception. Although our primary focus has always been cervical cancer, we have broadened our efforts over recent years to include head and neck cancers, as they are all tied to the HPV virus.   Our educational programming has simpler components geared to the lay person or high school student, or can be more medically specific, as would be appropriate for dental professionals. As there is so much work to be done to educate about HPV and it's connection to cancer, no audience should be overlooked.  This project aims to both broaden our educational reach within local high schools, as well as to create a platform for wide distribution of dental tool kit materials online.
1014085	2498.0	Flagstaff-Coconino County Public Library Training 2016-2017	DESCRIPTION: Residents of Coconino County, because it is the second largest county by area in the United States with many rural populations that lack access to easily attainable medical care, face many challenges regarding health and wellness and resources for information about health and wellness.  Some communities are more than 100 miles from a library and/or a health care facility.  The Public Health Services District for Coconino County sees significant rates of injury, death from injury, diabetes, communicable diseases, poor oral hygiene, tobacco use, and poor nutrition.  More than 26% of children in Coconino County (and 28% of children in Flagstaff, AZ) live in poverty.  The public library is a hub for the community, especially the underserved, and its partnership with the Public Health Services District, which this population relies on for health services, will have a significant impact toward increasing awareness of health information resources.  The goal is to build a trust relationship that will increase residents' comfort level with using the library to access quality, research-based health information resources.  Reaching this goal will help achieve the ultimate goal, which is illness and injury prevention.
1014086	5000.0	Technology Improvement: Whatcom Taking Action and SEAS	DESCRIPTION: The Arc of Whatcom County serves as the lead agency for Whatcom Taking Action, a collaborative of community leaders, parents, service and care providers working to create a cohesive system of services and support for children impacted by developmental, behavioral and other special healthcare needs. As part of Taking Action, the SEAS (Single Entry Access to Services) program, housed at the Opportunity Council, provides a centralized intake system and single point of contact for families to connect to resources and information. Taking Action's Family Tools Team also creates family friendly resource guides and informational handouts of a variety of topics relevant to for Children with Special Health Care Needs which we post to our website and social media. This project will provide SEAS Navigators (intake managers) with updated computers to efficiently manage the growing number of children/families requesting developmental/behavioral/special healthcare resource referral assistance in Whatcom County.
1014087	4950.0	Technology Improvement: Chelan-Douglas Health District Website Improvement Project	DESCRIPTION: The Chelan-Douglas Health District website improvement project is aimed at improving the ability of English and Spanish speaking community members and healthcare professionals in Chelan and Douglas counties, to find and use essential health information online.  There is a strong need in our health jurisdiction to improve our web presence and the information that is offered to our residents via our website.  Included in the new web design will be a new user-friendly design, search function, mobile site, and provide necessary content in Spanish.  Ultimately an improved web presence will foster a safer and healthier community for all populations by improving access to critical health information for both residents and providers and improving health literacy.
1014088	12000.0	Community Health Outreach: Comics and Medicine 2017 Conference	"DESCRIPTION: This project will bring the Comics and Medicine 2017 Conference to Seattle, WA on June 15-17, 2017 at the Seattle Public Library. The Comics and Medicine 2017 Conference seeks to engage health providers, health information professionals, artists, academics and members of the local community in the use of comics as a resource to provide accessible health information and communicate health-related experiences. This year's theme, Access Points, will draw attention to how comics represent health-related accessibility issues and disability communities, and how they can reduce barriers to health information and education. In keeping with this theme, the conference will offer keynote speaker events that are free and open to the public, held in Seattle's Central Library, to encourage broad participation. A mix of panel discussions, hands-on workshops, collaborative working groups, and a unique ""Comics Marketplace"" will allow multiple modes for participants to explore comics as a resource and medium for promoting conversations and information about health experiences.  This award will fund travel and lodging expenses, plus honoraria for three invited speakers, and workshop materials."
1014105	7756.0	Using tablet computers to enhance patient education, patient communication, and health awareness	DESCRIPTION: Managing a primary care panel is an ever-changing experience.  Physicians, medical support staff, administrative staff and patients need to be engaged in the circle of care.  Tablet computers, through their multimedia capabilities, interactive features, and touch screen functionality can enhance learning across patient populations. Tablet computers can also act as communication portal and a care engagement tool. Tablets offer better consistency and quality control of the educational message while also overcoming literacy and language barriers.  With this grant, Beth Israel Deaconess Healthcare would purchase 3 Microsoft Surface PRO tablet computers, 1 wireless printer, 3 Surface Secure stands and 1 ReadyDock UV (RD5) machine for use in the primary care clinic. The tablet computers would enhance patient education and engagement on available healthcare resources, as well as provide communication applications that will address language barriers. The ReadyDock UV machine would provide on-site disinfection between patient users, and would also enable charging and secure storage of the tablets. The wireless printer would enable patients to print handouts to bring home with them for further review.
1014106	3325.0	Express Outreach: Great Lakes Science Boot Camp	DESCRIPTION: Now in its third year, the Great Lakes Science Boot Camp for Librarians provides affordable educational and networking opportunities for STEM Librarians working in the Greater Midwest Region. The 2017 Science Boot Camp will be hosted at Michigan State University (MSU) in East Lansing, Michigan from July 19-21 and will build on the success of earlier Boot Camps held at Wayne State University and the University of Notre Dame. The Boot Camp follows an established model consisting of two and a half days of sessions presenting on cutting edge STEM research led by distinguished faculty members. The three half day sessions are arranged by theme and feature two faculty speakers. Session topics proposed for the 2017 Boot Camp include Sports Research, Agriculture and Natural Resources, and Biogeochemistry and Ecology. The presentations feature overviews and emerging trends in the field, along with descriptions of current research, methodologies, and the faculty member's interaction with the library.

Several proposed speakers will address public health related topics, including Dr. Irv Widders on legume production and nutrition, Dr. Chris Kuenze on sports injuries and rehabilitation, and Dr. Gary Blanchard on the chemistry of concussions. Additionally, the Flint Water Crisis is the planned topic of the keynote address. The planning committee has contacted Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, who came to national prominence from her lead role in uncovering the water crisis in Flint, and could speak on the public health implications of a lead contaminated public water supply. In the event that Dr. Hanna-Attisha is unavailable the planning committee will target other speakers working and researching on the Flint Water Crisis and its health implications...
1014107	7689.0	Rethinking Early Neurosurgery: The Harvey Cushing collection	DESCRIPTION: The Cushing Center, which opened in 2010, brought renewed attention to the materials within Harvey Cushing's collections, which include, beyond the Registry, over 200 boxes of archival material, made available through an online finding aid (http://hdl.handle.net/10079/fa/mssa.ms.0160). The brains and tumors are being used in research again, including genetic sequencing of 20 specimens related to acromegaly, gigantism, and Cushing's disease. Because of the renewed interest in Cushing's research and work, and the massive nature of his collection, staff at the Medical Library and Cushing Center are working to document the 10-15,000 glass plate negatives that are part of the Registry. These negatives formed a major part of Cushing's research, and information from the negatives is the linchpin connecting the brains with the patients and tumors depicted in the photographs. The photographs themselves are a visual portal into early neurosurgery, depicting the different methods Cushing used to gain access to tumors nestled in the brain, as well as an entryway into patient populations in the early 20th century. For this grant, the Library and Cushing Center is requesting funding for 2 students and equipment to assist in cataloging the glass-plate negatives, which will be made available over time, following HIPAA guidelines, through a larger database. The larger goal is to have approximately 2600 glass plate negatives cataloged by April 30th, constituting nearly a 1/4 to 1/3 of the larger collection.

The knowledge I gain through this course will improve her ability to educate students and assist faculty at the new medical school opening at her institution in the fall of 2017.
1014110	6850.0	Digital Divide Award: Fairmont Senior Resources	"DESCRIPTION: To support the mission of the National Network for Libraries of Medicine, the Library will provide resources to the residents (consumers) with health information as outlined in Aim 10. ""Aim 10: The GMR staff will improve GMR consumer's understanding of quality health information resources available on the Internet so that they make better informed health care decisions throughout the five years of the award."" Though the project will be targeting the older adult population in the Fairmont Community, anyone from the community will be welcomed to participate in the programs and services made available through the grant. There is a core group of fifty seniors who have voiced not having computers or Internet access and the need to learn more about computers to access information, especially pertaining to health literacy. With the appropriate equipment, the Library can bring the community Internet access and have on-going educational classes as outlined in the objectives and implementation. The White Oak Library District has been providing services to the Fairmont Community. The Children's librarians provide services to the schools, the Adult Services librarians provide research and educational activities in the branch library, and the Outreach Services librarians provide materials, home delivery services, and resources to the senior citizen residents and daycare students. Over the past four years, the Outreach Services monthly presentations provide information to a core group of approximately 50 seniors based on the needs of the community. We are limited to resources in print through books or printed copies. There is a need, especially for the older adult population, to have access to current and vital health information and resources.The Fairmont Community residents have expressed a need to expand their knowledge of medical and other resources presented at their monthly meetings."
1014125	4907.0	Technology Improvement Award 70	DESCRIPTION: Dahlgren Memorial Library (DML) at Georgetown University Medical Center (GUMC) plans to seek funding from the National Network of Libraries of Medicine Southeastern/Atlantic Region (NNLM SEA) for a project designed to deploy and assess the utility of iPad Mini tablet devices for use by 5 residents in the Neurosurgery Residency Training Program at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital (MGUH) in Washington, DC. When the iPad mini devices were released by Apple, Inc. in early November 2012 the devices seemed to possess the perfect synergy filling the need for a device which could be easily accessed and used in a busy clinical setting due to the smaller screen and lighter weight in comparison to the bulkier 1st through 4th generation iPads. The smaller and more streamline design of the iPad mini devices seemed to suggest the ergonomically optimal clinical tool for use in a point-of-care setting in which the device could be easily stored in a clinician's white coat and could be held in one hand for rapid retrieval and use while writing or entering data into an electronic health record. Due to the recent availability of the iPad mini devices little data has been tabulated or studies conducted to determine the clinical utility of these devices. Niehaus et al. (Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Resident Use of iPad Mini Mobile Devices. PM R. 2015 May;7(5):512-8. PubMed PMID: 25661459) states there is minimal research on the use of smaller tablet devices in residency programs, and most of the previous studies were conducted with standard-sized iPad tablet devices. DML staff working with clinicians at GUMC and MGUH propose the purchase and deployment of the devices and to study their utility in a busy, point-of-care clinical setting as the Residents rotate through the Clinical Neurosurgery Service at MGUH, MedStar Washington Hospital Center (MWHC) and Children's National Medical Center (CNMC), both in Washington DC.

1014128	4998.0	Health Information Outreach Award 72	DESCRIPTION: Key to well-being and health is access to authoritative and comprehensible health information. Our aim in this project is to raise awareness of resources from the National Library of Medicine especially Medline Plus that target consumers and provide a wealth of health information. This project aligns with the Welch Medical Library's strategic goal of community outreach and with the Johns Hopkins Medicine strategic priority of patient- and family-centered care with a specific goal to partner with patients, families and others to eliminate preventable harm and optimize patient outcomes and experience while reducing health care costs.  We plan to participate in a number of events that will be attended by community members, patients, and their families, and we will demonstrate the NLM tools, help answer health questions using these tools, and distribute information about accessing the resources.
1014130	4995.0	Health Information Outreach Award 74	DESCRIPTION: The use of institutional repositories is becoming more common in health care universities. The Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine (PCOM) Library has an institutional repository (IR), the DigitalCommons@PCOM. The PCOM Library must ensure that researchers, faculty, and students want to use open access resources and submit articles, posters, and other materials to the DigitalCommons@PCOM by educating them about publication policies, author rights, and open access. Additionally, the project will provide education on finding and evaluating resources that are found online in open access resources and peer-reviewed journals. This outreach to our faculty, students, and researchers will address misconceptions about publishing in IRs. To improve the use of our IR and publication in open access journals, we need to dispel any myths by having experts speak about the issue.
1014131	5000.0	Health Information Outreach Award 75	DESCRIPTION: This a pilot project to develop curriculum to teach current and future healthcare professionals how to address patient needs throughout the state of Georgia with health literacy in mind. The goal is to improve a clinician's ability to identify and communicate effectively with patients at the appropriate level of health literacy. This project will be the first phase to train health science librarians on health literacy tools, how to implement these tools, and how to teach others, including but not limited to medical school students, practicing clinicians, and other interested librarians. During this phase we will review the health needs of Georgians and create curriculum using resources available through NN/LM to address the most common health disparities in the state. A core group of health science librarians will receive in depth health literacy training through conferences and the Georgia Alliance for Health Literacy. The curriculum will then be tested in senior centers, youth after school programs, and in multiple hospital settings to clinical educators, medical students, and patients. Once the curriculum is finalized, training will be offered to the Georgia Health Sciences Library Association and the Atlanta Health Science Libraries Consortium members to take to their institutions and hospitals for student/staff training. Phase two will continue with outreach efforts for train-the-trainer classes and additional community outreach projects in the Atlanta metro region and rural northern and southern regions in Georgia. This phase will include additional surveys and interviews on the effectiveness of the curriculum for both clinicians and community members.
1014132	4902.0	Medical Library Project 76	DESCRIPTION: Scanning for Science: Increasing Access to the Future of Medicine: The Nova Southeastern University Health Professions Division Library plays a central role in supporting education and research, and works to provide access to new technologies for students and faculty.The NSU HPD Library supports seven colleges, Medicine, Pharmacy, Dentistry, Optometry, Health Care Sciences, Nursing, and Medical Sciences, so the library is an ideal space for collaboration. The library currently provides 3D printing and hopes to expand this service with free 3D scanning. The library currently runs two 3D printers. The location of the printers allows access for students and faculty from all disciplines. Informal conversations with students and faculty indicate an interest and demand for a high quality scanner. The university's students will see these technologies in practice after they graduate, so we offer them the opportunity to use them now.  The NSU College of Pharmacy's research lab studies the regulation of the cardiovascular system via angiotensin functions in rodent brain and other organs. Previous student research has shown the utility and cost effectiveness of using a 3D printed brain mold designed with CAD software, to retain the organ's structural integrity. The Frozen Brain Mold can be viewed at https://skfb.ly/WTGV. This was a very time consuming process. For this demonstration project an image of 3D scanned kidneys will be used to design a 3D printed customized mold for research, storage, and transportation. Using a 3D scanner will let us quickly create more accurate customized kidney mold units for pharmacological research, which will then be shared through the NIH 3D Print Exchange.  Adding a free scanning service to the library and sharing on the NIH 3D Print Exchange will add to pharmacological research, serve as an example for other future projects and enhance health care education, and consumer health education. REMARKS: The five major objectives designated in a prior section will be measured using a variety of indicators including post project surveys and interviews to determine the efficacy of the project as well as to discern the perceptions of participants relative to project benefits. Consistent with the project goal/objectives, surveys will include but not be limited to the following items:  * Demographic Information (i.e., current status, college, etc.) * Efficacy of Training Workshops * Knowledge base prior to training workshops * Frequency of 3D Scanner Use * Application/Implementation Uses  * Sustainability of Use * Tracking of users' presentations, etc.  Interview sessions will gather data on the strengths and challenges of the project as well as recommendations for improvement as part of the formative evaluation process. Ultimately, data gathered will support to what extent the project has met its objectives as well as next steps to institutionalize the project.

1014245	16075.0	Cultivating Health Improvements Through Connections Between Seniors in High School and Seniors in Retirement Homes	DESCRIPTION: This initiative involves high school seniors interviewing seniors at retirement homes. What legacy do the elders hope to leave behind? What stories do they fondly remember? What foods became their favorites? What connections in these stories are there to our ancestors and early inhabitants of the Cape? How does medicine today compare to the medicines of old that perhaps grew in the fields and marshes along the Cape?  We plan to have the elder seniors teach the young seniors a thing or two, while the youngsters teach the elders how to navigate today's technology to learn answers on their own, and to rekindle the lessons from long ago that may have been forgotten. Together, we plan to have this partnership planting various shrubs, flowers and perhaps trees, which may have purposes beyond ornamental.  Our project involves students from Cape Cod Technical School, elders from Thirwood Place (and other retirement homes on the Cape), the Town of Dennis Advisory Committee on Disabilities, and the Department of Parks and Public Works. Horticulture students will create a list of native plants that are suitable for growing at John A. Kelley Park in Dennis, around the Dennis Braille Trail.

1014706	9500.0	Community Health Outreach: Improving Diagnosis and Treatment of Dementia in Primary Care	DESCRIPTION: Washington State has the third highest rate of death from Alzheimer's disease of any state in the nation. This is expected to increase 40% in next 10 years and 181% over the next 30 years. In many practices in Washington State, there are no guidelines to increase quality of care for screening, diagnosis, or treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. This is costly to the health care system and highly burdensome to patients, caregivers, and the community. The current project seeks to develop a curriculum of evidence-based approaches which are aligned with Bree Collaborative, Alzheimer's Disease Working Group and Alzheimer's State Plan for appropriate screening and diagnosis for Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and use it to train rural and community health providers. This will help these providers better support family and other caregivers of those with dementia, manage patients' medications and co-morbid conditions, offer supportive care, assist with advance care planning, and refer patients to other resources such as consumer health information sites, counseling, senior day programs or palliative care of those with dementia.

The primary objective is to use the two events to increase patient and staff awareness of the ZSFG Library in a way that encourages communication, engagement, and active learning.
1014727	4907.0	Technology Improvement Award 70	DESCRIPTION: Dahlgren Memorial Library (DML) at Georgetown University Medical Center (GUMC) plans to seek funding from the National Network of Libraries of Medicine Southeastern/Atlantic Region (NNLM SEA) for a project designed to deploy and assess the utility of iPad Mini tablet devices for use by 5 residents in the Neurosurgery Residency Training Program at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital (MGUH) in Washington, DC. When the iPad mini devices were released by Apple, Inc. in early November 2012 the devices seemed to possess the perfect synergy filling the need for a device which could be easily accessed and used in a busy clinical setting due to the smaller screen and lighter weight in comparison to the bulkier 1st through 4th generation iPads. The smaller and more streamline design of the iPad mini devices seemed to suggest the ergonomically optimal clinical tool for use in a point-of-care setting in which the device could be easily stored in a clinician's white coat and could be held in one hand for rapid retrieval and use while writing or entering data into an electronic health record. Due to the recent availability of the iPad mini devices little data has been tabulated or studies conducted to determine the clinical utility of these devices. Niehaus et al. (Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Resident Use of iPad Mini Mobile Devices. PM R. 2015 May;7(5):512-8. PubMed PMID: 25661459) states there is minimal research on the use of smaller tablet devices in residency programs, and most of the previous studies were conducted with standard-sized iPad tablet devices. DML staff working with clinicians at GUMC and MGUH propose the purchase and deployment of the devices and to study their utility in a busy, point-of-care clinical setting as the Residents rotate through the Clinical Neurosurgery Service at MGUH, MedStar Washington Hospital Center (MWHC) and Children's National Medical Center (CNMC), both in Washington DC.
1014729	18408.0	Outreach: Information Needs Assessment of Unaffiliated North Dakota Rural Health Professionals and Biomedical Researchers, Phase II	"DESCRIPTION: In Phase I of this project, University of North Dakota (UND) Health Sciences Library administered an information needs survey to unaffiliated North Dakota (ND) health care professionals in early 2017.  The results provided useful information, and several individuals volunteered to provide additional information in follow-up interviews.     UND librarians plan to further assess information needs of unaffiliated ND rural health professionals in Phase II of this project by conducting telephone and/or in-person interviews and possibly focus groups of health profession leaders to obtain additional and more in-depth data. This data will guide selection of specific NLM and other information resources to be highlighted in outreach training and other activities to meet professionals' information needs. In addition, librarians plan to expand relationships with tribal college librarians and researchers begun in 2016-2017 and further explore provision of training, services, and/or possibly information resources, to these populations.   This project will support the mission of the National Network of Libraries of Medicine (NNLM), specifically ""to advance the progress of medicine and improve the public health by providing all U.S. health professionals with equal access to biomedical information.""

In response to these funding agency mandates, academic libraries are increasingly providing data management services to university researchers. A better understanding of the impact of DMPs on grant awards and grant-funded research will enhance library data services for academic researchers, promote data stewardship and data sharing, and could potentially increase researchers' competitiveness for grant awards. This project aims to understand:   - 	The common elements of funded DPMs, including DMPs from researchers in health sciences.   - 	How researchers use data management plans during and after the research process, including how data management plans support data stewardship and data publication.   The proposed study will analyze 200 DMPs from NIH and NSF grant applications, and then conduct 20 follow-up interviews of researchers from funded projects, selected from among the authors of the 200 analyzed DMPs. This research will ultimately result in a DMP toolkit for health sciences researchers. The toolkit will be shared with the broader library community through conference presentations and publications. By analyzing DMPs and data management practices across disciplines, the proposed study aims to apply a cross-disciplinary perspective in order to build better health sciences data management practices. By building a better understanding of DMPs' impact on grant awards and grant-funded research, this project will help health sciences libraries build stronger data services and promote the value of those services to relevant stakeholders, ultimately facilitating better data management and sharing practices for health sciences researchers."

1014815	14872.0	University of Pittsburgh Data Catalog	DESCRIPTION: Major funding agencies have stipulated that data from funded research should be made available for retrieval and secondary analysis. Many journals are following suit, requiring authors to share supporting data. Researchers have reservations about sharing their data however, expressing concerns about the cost involved to make the data available, maintaining patient's privacy, overcoming commercial contract restrictions, and/or fears of proper attribution, wrongful use, or competition. Libraries can help researchers overcome some of these obstacles and support them in making their data findable and accessible. A data catalog would provide a low-barrier way for researchers to make their data discoverable without the need to deposit full datasets into a data repository such as figshare or Zenodo. This project proposes for the Health Sciences Library System (HSLS) at the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) to implement the data catalog code created by the New York University (NYU) Health Sciences Library to aggregate University of Pittsburgh health sciences datasets and make them discoverable; significantly increasing the access to datasets created at our institution. We will expand on NYUs successes by editing the existing metadata scheme to capture the data of bench researchers, a population that NYU has not focused on to date, and to evaluate other possible search interfaces to increase usability. We will utilize our strong library liaison program and existing partnerships with stakeholder on campus to reach our proposed goals.

1014888	15000.0	Technology Improvement Award 89: Mobile Health Literacy Classes 2017	"DESCRIPTION: For 17 years P. I. Advocates International, Inc. (PIA) has forged meaningful partnerships with community and faith organizations as a ""mobile"" training program. PIA has perfected a 2.5hr hands-on computer workshop designed specifically for disproportionately served neighborhoods. Being ""mobile"" has allowed PIA to train community members where they live and/or work. We need to updated our training equipment for the three outreach teams operating in the Washington Metropolitan Area. Our work load is increasing and will continue to increase, but working with poorly functioning equipment is greatly slowing our progress. We are constantly encountering people with low health literacy and low computer literacy. This misfortune has very tangible associated costs, including poor disease management, increased percentage of repeat hospital visits, and incorrect medication use. We have steadfastly taught participants how to find reliable web based health information resources and simultaneously taught them skills in access online health information using laptop computers. By presenting our program as mobile computer workstations we have consistently patronized many locations in DC. We have found that many people in low income and economically disadvantaged neighborhoods struggles with basic literacy, health literacy, and computer literacy. For these underserved citizens learning health-related tasks, such as finding and sharing easy-to-read health information is a plus. In addition, we wish to continue providing and increasing our workshops by upgrading our training equipment, e.g. laptop computers and wireless LCD projectors. Our hands-on classes will eliminate the disconnect between information providers and information seekers."

1014894	10775.0	Medical Library Project 101: Health Literacy Summit	DESCRIPTION: Low health literacy affects people of any age, income, race or background, and it puts an estimated 90 million Americans at risk. Whether it is interpreting instructions on a prescription bottle, deciphering pages of discharge instructions, completing a health history, or navigating the healthcare system, low health literacy predisposes patients to poor health outcomes and higher rates of preventable hospital admissions.  At first glance, health literacy appears to be a problem that lies with the patient and is incumbent upon them to acquire the necessary skills. However, it is now understood, and generally accepted, that the primary responsibility for improving health literacy lies with the healthcare and information professionals. As information professionals, librarians can play a pivotal role in working together with healthcare professionals to ensure that health information and services can be understood and used by all Americans.  PML librarians also led a 2016 research project which assessed the health literacy sensitive characteristics of the UTMC in order to provide recommendations for promoting changes based on evidence. Librarians partnered with UTMC stakeholders and University of Tennessee graduate students to implement the assessment tools from Health Literacy Environment of Hospitals and Health Centers. The research collected data on five areas of the health literacy environment at UTMC using established research methods.   Dissemination of our findings and a discussion of how other health care organizations and libraries can reduce barriers to low health literacy patients is crucial. The Health Literacy Summit is scheduled for June 2-3, 2017, and will include both national and local speakers, hands-on breakouts, and dissemination of our research findings through a panel presentation. Funding is being requested from NNLM/SEA Medical Library Project Grant to partially fund this event

A panel on Health Literacy will be held as one session; we are asking Dr. Patricia Brennan, NLM Director, to be our keynote speaker (not confirmed yet); and presenting a CE course on Systematic Reviews. Expenses would include AV technology equipment rental for presentations, per diem, hotel and travel for speakers. Other use would go toward program publication costs, hotel internet charges, poster display board rentals, etc."
1014907	4206.0	Medical Library Project 105: Supporting a Healthier Mississippi	"DESCRIPTION: Mississippi has one of the highest rates of low birth weight and premature babies in the U.S. and the University of Mississippi Medical Center's newborn division is actively promoting breastfeeding among new mothers to benefit these babies. The CDC's ""Healthy People 2020"" breastfeeding objective is for 81.9% of infants to be breastfed for any length of time, or ""ever breastfed."" The national average for infants being ""ever breastfed"" is 81.1%, and Mississippi is currently ranked last at 52%. Additionally, 23.9% of breastfeeding in Mississippi lasts for at least 6 months, compared to the national average of 51.8%. The Medical Center currently has two ""Nursing Mother's Rooms"" on the 195 acre campus, but both are in the hospital area. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 states that, in addition to allowing a nursing mother time to pump breast milk, ""Employers are also required to provide a place, other than a bathroom, that is shielded from view and free from intrusion from coworkers and the public, which may be used by an employee to express breast milk (https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs73.htm)."" Rowland Medical Library (RML) is providing space for a Nursing Mother's Room within the Library. The close proximity to the educational buildings will enable students, faculty, and staff to have a private and secure location to pump breast milk. RML seeks to contribute in two ways: 1. Expand current digital signage within the medical center to promote free NLM resources including LactMed, one of the databases found within ToxNet, along with other NLM databases. 2. Provide a large monitor and computer within the Nursing Mother's Room to give students, faculty, and staff the ability to privately search for information in LactMed. While Nursing Mother's Rooms are becoming more common in libraries, RML is hoping to do its part to ensure healthy babies."
1014909	14998.0	Health Information Outreach Award 111: Health Information Literacy Outreach to Promote Farmworker Health	DESCRIPTION: There are profound health inequalities for migrant and seasonal farmworkers. Exacerbating these health inequalities are barriers to quality health information for migrant and seasonal farmworkers and their families. By linking farmworker youth and farmworker health outreach workers with NLM resources, this project seeks to improve access to health information. This project is a partnership between East Carolina University's Joyner Library and Student Action with Farmworkers (SAF), non-profit farmworker advocacy organization founded in 1992. The project integrates training on NLM products, iPads, and internet access into a leadership and college pipeline program for farmworker youth (SAF's Levante Leadership Institute). To broaden the project's impact, additional trainings reach recent college graduates participating in a SAF Into the Fields fellowship on farmworker health; farmworker health program outreach workers from rural health clinics; and, attendees at North Carolina's largest gathering of farmworker health advocates, workers, and researchers. Finally, to improve future work promoting equality in information access, we assess information needs experienced during the 2017 growing season by SAF health outreach fellows and Levante youth and their families. This effort meets NNLM goals of equalizing access to health information and promoting vulnerable consumers' ability to make informed health decisions.
1014910	15000.0	Technology Improvement Award 113: Bioinformatics and Health Informatics Portal for Medical Sciences Campus at University of Puerto Rico	DESCRIPTION: This project proposes the creation of a bioinformatics and health informatics portal to primarily serve students, professors, researchers, clinicians and general public at the Medical Science Campus, University of Puerto Rico (MSC-UPR) and eventually to all medical community in the island. Currently, there is not up-to-date source of information on these subjects in Puerto Rico. Then, there is a need of a portal with access to bioinformatics and health informatics information and tools oriented to medical sciences institutions, as well as the medical and general community. This site will be also available in English and Spanish. Our project team is integrated by members with different expertise, from the Bioinformatics and Health Informatics Group (BHIG) and the library Conrado F. Asenjo at MSC-UPR. BHIG develops and improves informatics applications and biomedical informatics tools, focused on health disparities by the design and implementation of software applications to manipulate and analyze biomedical data. The library at MSC-UPR has an online public access catalog and other health related information that is available through the library website. These two groups decide to join efforts for the development of this portal. This project funds will be used to secure the infrastructure, i.e. hardware and software, for the design, implementation, publication and update of the portal. National Library of Medicine resources, such as PubMed, GenBank, MedlinePlus, ToxNet and so on, will be accessed from the portal. In addition, some of these and other bioinformatics tools from NCBI will be installed in the local server for faster and easier utilization. This portal will contribute to mission of the NNLM because provides health professionals and general individuals with equal access to bioinformatics and health informatics information and tools to advance the progress of medicine and improve health care.
1014911	15000.0	"Health Information Outreach Award 115: ""TORDS""- Technology Outreach to Reduce health Disparities and Stigma"	DESCRIPTION: McDowell Cares- is a non-profit/profit collaboration in the Town of Northfork, McDowell County, West Virginia. This collaboration (between South Central Educational (SCED) and Bennady's Restaurant) formed out of the owners concerns of the lack of health equity, youth leadership, and the area's poverty levels. This partnership will provide rural community residents with access to electronic health information, prevention interventions and internet access to reliable quality health information and resources.
1014912	15000.0	Health Information Outreach Award 116: Community-Based Interventions and Partnership to Improve Health Literacy	"DESCRIPTION: This proposal describes Phase 2 of a two-phase health literacy program in Charlottesville, Virginia. It aligns with the NNLM and SEA's mission to help people ""make informed decisions about their health,"" to promote healthy behaviors, prevent costly and debilitating illness, and improve health outcomes. Phase 1, ""Coming to the Table, Needs Assessment, and Planning,"" was funded by NNLM SEA Outreach Award 73. The full report for Phase 1 is due by May 20, 2017. We can briefly report here that our goal was achieved and lays a strong foundation for Phase 2. In Phase 1, 30 individuals from 16 local organizations came together to learn about health literacy from an expert speaker, to connect with each other and strengthen partnerships, and to consider partnership on future community-based health literacy interventions. Attendee feedback was highly positive, and, more specifically, three different ideas for interventions were suggested to us immediately following the event. Phase 2, ""Community-Based Interventions"" is proposed here for funding. The three organizations that have reached out to us suggest the following ideas: 1) Greater Charlottesville Improving Pregnancy Outcomes Workgroup (a multi-organization effort) - prenatal education for mothers and train-the-trainer education for IPO, 2) City of Charlottesville, Community Mental Health and Wellness Coalition - reducing stigma and raising public awareness, and 3) Ronald McDonald House Charities (working with pediatric hospital patients & families) - self-assessment for the caregivers and families of hospitalized patients. The submission deadline for Phase 2 comes very soon after completion of Phase 1, so we have yet to explore the above ideas in detail, but we will begin immediately. Several of our intervention ideas were described in detail for Phase 1, but we remain flexible because our goal is still to design effective interventions that meet target populations' specific needs and abilities."

1014914	5000.0	Health Information Outreach Award 118: MaFlo's Health and Awareness Team Internet/Computer Training	DESCRIPTION: The project that we want to do will be teaching Participants how to use the Internet/Computer to find reliable health information online using the MedlinePlus.gov and NN/LM SE/A websites. We plan to continue our project we started pairing Senior Citizens with Teens so that the Teens could teach the Senior Citizens how to use the Amazon Fire 8 HD Tablet to find online reliable health information on the internet using MedlinePlus.gov. We plan to reach as many Participants in our Community as possible because they don't have online access to the internet nor do they know how to use the different types of technology. Our plan is to get as many Participants involved as possible
1014915	8950.0	EOA 2017-18: Leveraging Health Literacy and Community Health Resources to Improve Senior Care	"DESCRIPTION: The overall goal of the proposed project is to strengthen and enhance access to local and national health information resources for the Washoe County, NV, community of seniors and senior caregivers, and to improve the capacity of regional caregivers to incorporate health information resources and health literacy best practices into patient care discharge planning and care management. The locus for outreach to both lay caregivers and the professional healthcare community is a website built collaboratively with the Community Foundation of Western Nevada and funded in part through a grant-funded project, ""Community Health Information Resource for Seniors (CHIRS),"" which is currently in beta testing. Funding will build on the CHIRS website work by engaging with healthcare providers who deliver discharge planning and care management services as well as caregivers and the lay community of seniors. As with the groundwork for this project, the focus will be on access to local services and online information resources; the hope is to improve the capacity of older adults to locate and integrate information that fosters a healthier and more self-reliant lifestyle. REMARKS: Nevada has one of the highest growth rates of seniors in the United States, which is reflected in the Washoe County, NV, demographic profile: Seniors currently form approximately 14% (58,216) of the total population. The next 10 years will see an increase of approximately 32% in this sector, making elders the fastest growing population segment in Washoe County.   This project has three primary target populations: healthcare and social service professionals who provide care for elders; family members who provide care for elders; and elders themselves who are seeking access to health information online and knowledge regarding availability of community health services related to aging."
1014916	6269.0	Health Information Needs of Parents/Caregivers of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Needs Assessment	DESCRIPTION: Parents/caregivers of children with developmental disabilities need information that will help them make decisions regarding their child's treatment and keep them safe and healthy.  The Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center (TTUHSC) Libraries propose to use a mixed-methods approach that will consist of semi-structured, focused interviews with key informants to develop a survey instrument that will then be used to collect data on the specific health information needs of parents/caregivers of children with autism spectrum disorder who participate in equine assisted activities at Camp Able at Buffalo Gap near Abilene, Texas.  Students enrolled in a Masters of Public Health program will receive training on ethical research involving human subjects and data collection procedures, and will assist librarians from TTUHSC in conducting focused interviews with assistants, teachers, and volunteers who assist and instruct children with autism spectrum disorder in equine-assisted learning activities at Camp Able of Buffalo Gap.  We will present our findings to stakeholders by means of presentations to Key Stakeholders at Camp Able of Buffalo Gap, as well as local (Abilene and Lubbock area) caregiver support groups, and also share our findings with public health professionals and librarians by means of posters and presentations at professional meetings.
1014926	10000.0	Medline Plus Community Engagement	DESCRIPTION: 15-40 Connection and the National Network of Libraries of Medicine both work to provide access to vital health information to improve quality of life and the healthcare experience. To close the gap in delayed diagnosis of cancer and provide the lifesaving advantage of early cancer detection, individuals need to be empowered through an integrated approach to health education that drives behavior change. 15-40 Connection is teaching audiences in high schools, universities, hospitals and corporations how to use personal health awareness to detect cancer earlier and improve cancer survival rates for everyone. A critical element of this education is continuity, reinforcement and access to reliable information and advice. Our partnership with NNLM will provide ongoing access to credible resources for reliable and up-to-date information to further empower patients with guidance regarding doctor/patient relationships, symptoms, confidentiality and patient's rights.
1014927	10000.0	HPV and Cancer Prevention Education for Oral Health Providers	DESCRIPTION: Human papillomavirus (HPV) remains the major cause of oropharyngeal and cervical cancer. Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Team Maureen have collaborated to promote educational efforts for dentists and dental hygienists on the connection of HPV and related cancers. Educational materials in the form of a downloadable Toolkit, were developed from the National Network of Libraries of Medicine (NLM) resources for use by oral health professionals to educate their patients about the connection between HPV and related cancers and to promote HPV vaccination as cancer prevention.  Last year's NNLM grant funding for the HPV Education: A Varied Approach Project made it possible for web based development and hosting of the Toolkit along with a successful outreach seminar to 125 providers at a recognized dental conference in Massachusetts (Yankee Dental Congress). Oral health providers who attended the seminar at Yankee Dental Congress welcomed the idea of the Toolkits to converse with their patients about HPV vaccination and cancer prevention. Phase II of this project will build upon these efforts by reaching out to a greater number of dental providers in New England and evaluate the use and efficacy of the Toolkits.  Brigham and Women's Hospital and Team Maureen will also partner with the Massachusetts Oral HPV/Prevention Taskforce to expand upon the importance of this public health priority.
1014946	10000.0	Preventing Preventable Death: Using Libraries to Promote Bleeding Control Education Initiatives	"DESCRIPTION: The leading cause of death for Americans under the age of 46 is trauma — a disabling or life-threatening physical injury that results from an event such as a motor vehicle crash, gun violence, or a fall . The City of Nashua and partners look to promote 1 awareness of this phenomenon and reduce the likelihood of death or permanent injury due to trauma through conducting ""Stop the Bleed"" initiatives in our libraries. The ""Stop the Bleed"" campaign was developed by a multidisciplinary workgroup including the National Security Council Staff, The White House, and the US Department of Health and Human Services. Stop the Bleed Focuses on building national resilience by preparing the public to save lives by raising awareness of basic actions to stop life-threatening bleeding following everyday emergencies and man-made and natural disasters. Using the networks, facilities, and expertise of the Nashua Public Library and academic libraries we hope to create a sustainable project that will enable responders and health officials to include bleeding control education in their health information outreach."
1014947	10000.0	CoughSpot 2017-18 Community Engagement Program	DESCRIPTION: We would like to extend the Program's reach to more of New England, all while streamlining the Program to teach people to appropriately cover their cough. We'd like to make the program available to more schools by providing a digitized curriculum, and streamline the Program by enhancing the effectiveness of the Program while constraining costs so we only mail posters and tattoos. We would like to partner with the Rhode Island Department of Health to reach people of all ages to expand the awareness of the importance of proper coughing and sneezing etiquette.
1014948	9868.0	Girls Inc. Healthy Living Project	DESCRIPTION: Girls Inc. of Worcester plans to offer a nine month program (July 2017- March 2018) for 90 high school girls enrolled in Eureka! (Girls Inc.'s capstone STEM- science, technology, engineering, and math- program) and 150 girls registered in Girls Inc.'safter school program. Girls Inc.'s multi-tiered Healthy Living Project aligns with NNLM's mission to broaden access to and awareness of health information resources, with an emphasis of using those resources provided by NLM. The project will complement and enhance Eureka! and Girls Inc. after school programs. Support will provide summer Externships for three 10th-11th grade  Eureka! participants; train up to 90 Eureka! participants in the use of research tools at the University of Massachusetts Lamar Sautter Library; develop a Healthy Living Curriculum for girls in grades K-2, 3-6 and 7-9; and enable Eureka! participants to deliver that curriculum during Girls Inc.'s After School Drop-In program .  Eureka! participants completing summer Externships at Girls Inc. (July 2017) will utilize their training in PubMed, Medline Plus, and other NLM resources to create age-appropriate Healthy Living Curricula for girls in grades K-9. The curricula will focus on nutrition and physical fitness; adding to the value of Girls Inc.'s fitness and nutrition program. The new curricula will be implemented during Girls Inc.'s after school activities from September 2017 through March of 2018.  In the fall of 2017, three Cohorts of Eureka! participants (90 girls grades 8-10) will visit the Lamar Sautter Library for tours and research training. Evaluation during each of these visits will determine if the participants have a better understanding of the use of the library resources. Some of those girls will assist with the facilitation of the Healthy Living Curriculum to our After School participants.
1014966	39914.0	How to find out about your health	DESCRIPTION: New, easy to understand and use tools that are accessible to patients and providers can facilitate better health information seeking and address many barriers associated with low health literacy that result in increased cost and negative outcomes, especially for those patient populations that experience significant health disparities. The UAMS Center for Health Literacy and UAMS health sciences libraries will develop and test a health literacy-based, patient engagement HANDbook with patients of primary care clinics that serve low income, minority, Spanish speaking, and rural patient populations. We will use health literacy best practices, health science library expertise, and provider input to develop a new How To Find Out About Your Health HANDbook. This HANDbook will be distributed to primary care providers with instructions on how to use the book with their patients to promote patient engagement, trust, confidence in health information seeking, and improved decision making. Complimentary resources will be implemented at neighboring public and heath science libraries. Key activities to be undertaken include: 1. Use patient, health science librarian, provider, and health literacy expert input to adapt and field test the How To Talk To Your Doctor (HTTTYD) HANDbook into a similar HANDbook that facilitates and guides patients' online health information seeking so that they can successfully access accurate, trustworthy, and relevant health information from NLM and other reputable sources as suggested by their provider. 2. Translate, using cculturally appropriate language, the How To Find Out About Your Health HANDbook into Spanish, with specific content directing patients to Spanish health information through NLM's online resources. 3. Disseminate and evaluate the impact of the How To Find Out About Your Health HANDbook in patient populations at clinics that serve low income, minority, Spanish speaking, and rural patients.
1014967	40000.0	Let's Talk Health	DESCRIPTION: Let's Talk Health (LTH) pilot project consists of a three-pronged approach designed to provide the following services:  1. LTH will provide health literacy instruction to existing ESL classes in the HOPE Literacy, Inc.'s sites, and the University of North Texas Health Science Center's (UNTHSC) Healthy Start and Building Bridges young mothers and refugee participants. 2. LTH will provide how-to instruction on working with the Limited English Proficiency (LEP) populations to those students in the health care professions career track at Tarrant County College (TCC) as well as the professional staff i.e., instructors in these divisions. 3. LTH will provide introduction classes about Health Literacy at community events sponsored by the Hispanic Wellness Coalition. This will include the Carnaval de Salud and the North Texas Health Fair. It is estimated that we will reach a minimum of 600 participants at these events.
1014986	2901.0	Youth Health Literacy Challenge	DESCRIPTION: The UT Health San Antonio Libraries serve as a Resource Library of the National Network of Libraries of Medicine for the South Central area of Texas. The major health concerns facing residents of South Central Texas continue to include diabetes, communicable diseases, cancer, and obesity. It is commonly accepted that health literacy rates remain low in the U.S. population at large but at even lower rates in underserved, Hispanic, and immigrant populations, which are large populations in South Central Texas. Sustainable community engagement leading to lasting collaborations with these populations is vital in order to impact health literacy rates. UT Health San Antonio Libraries is seeking funding for the Youth Health Literacy Challenge, a program aimed at promoting health literacy through NLM resources at four San Antonio Public Library (SAPL) branches that are feeding sites for the North East Independent School District (NEISD) Summer Food Service Program, or Summer Feeding Program. During the 2015-2016 school year, it was reported that 45% of NEISD students received free and reduced meals. The feeding sites were chosen based on data showing that a large portion of the student body at neighboring schools have low family income, an indication of a high risk for poor health outcomes. The Youth Health Literacy Challenge will encourage youth in grades 3-12 to seek out health information in a fun and engaging way and bring awareness to NLM resources that may influence the practice of healthy behaviors. The program will be carried out in a fashion similar to the library's popular Summer Reading Program with youth logging their activities. Youth will also receive a calendar that features NLM resources. This program has the potential to reach more than 2,200 children as well as parents who may assist children participating in the program.
1014987	14148.0	Health Links at the Library: Increasing Health Literacy Through Websites for Small Oklahoma Public Libraries	DESCRIPTION: According to a 2015 Pew Research Study, 73% of people who visit public libraries in America go looking for answers about their health. Furthermore, a recent study by the Institute of Museum and Library Services showed that over a 12-month period, an estimated 28 million people in the United States used library computers or sought assistance from librarians for health and wellness issues, including learning about medical conditions, finding health care providers, and assessing health insurance options. Public library websites can provide their communities with curated, credible digital resources about health and wellness. However, many small Oklahoma public libraries lack a library website. Oklahoma Department of Libraries (ODL) will develop a basic public library website for a pilot group of small Oklahoma libraries that do not have a library website. The websites will include webpages of credible health resources so that community members can access information about their health, from either at the library or through any internet-enabled device. Because these small libraries have very limited staff and are often unable to travel to ODL for training, and because the library staff in these small communities often lack the technical knowledge to maintain a website, ODL library consultants will travel to the pilot sites to train library staff in website maintenance and health literacy, focusing on the health resources we will develop for their website. Local community health partners and library patrons will be invited to a follow-up training to learn how to use the health resources on the new website. Promotional materials will be developed to publicize the libraries' health literacy resources. As part of this initiative, each pilot site with be provided necessary technology for public access. REMARKS: Outcome: Library staff will feel more confident in researching health issues. Indicators: A questionnaire will determine if library staff is more confident in researching health issues for library patrons. Qualitative data to understand how librarians feel about this project will be collected and reported. Objective: 75% of library staff will feel more confident in researching health issues for library patrons. Outcome: Library staff will learn web maintenance skills to maintain their new websites with current health resource links. Indicators: In an inquiry to other State Library Agencies in the US, it was determined that one of the biggest problems SLAs had helping their local libraries with websites was getting the libraries to update the websites on a regular basis. ODL will conduct monthly follow up calls to the libraries during the grant reporting period to provide assistance and encouragement with website maintenance and use of the health resources. A follow up call report sheet will be created to document calls and responses. Staff will also install a link-checker plugin on the websites so that library staff will be alerted by e-mail when a link is broken so that they can fix it. ODL will periodically send new resources that the libraries can add to their websites. A project support group will be created and encouraged, so that participating libraries can contact each other with questions and share best practices. Objective: 80% of pilot libraries will update their new library websites monthly, to make sure links to health resources are working and to add updates. Outcome: Health resources training participants will learn how to use the NLM resources to help patrons find answers to their questions about health. Indicator: Quizzes will be administered at the end of the health resources training sessions to determine success in being able to look up health information using the NLM resources on the libraries' websites.
1014988	14635.0	A Geographically Focused Health Information Outreach Project	DESCRIPTION: Zip code 75212 is an economically disadvantaged area of West Dallas. There are numerous organizations in this 11 square mile area that are trying to help residents. We can partner with several of these organizations to provide training on finding free authoritative health information. We have existing established relationships or have communicated with a community organization, a public library, a recreation center, and a church to provide health information services to 75212 residents. Our goal is to make a measureable difference in the ability to locate and use health information by the people that we connect with.
1014989	14653.0	Community Health Workshop: Promoting Healthy Communities by Increasing Knowledge	DESCRIPTION: The Community Health Workshop project seeks to utilize and build on the role of community spaces such as libraries, senior centers, and community centers to facilitate access to knowledge and promote action amongst the underrepresented and underserved in Tarrant County, specifically the Hispanic and African American populations. The proposed project introduces community members to reliable consumer health information from the National Library of Medicine. Workshops will be offered in English or Spanish and is supported by public health professionals in Tarrant County and from the University of North Texas Health Science Center. The overarching objectives of the program are to 1) increase access to knowledge - by increasing awareness of resources such as MedlinePlus.gov, 2) develop health literacy - by developing the skill to evaluate health resources online and 3) foster participation - by having open conversations about health concerns culminating in small health projects designed by the participants. The objective of the project is to empower individuals to explore health information confidently and be motivated to promote community health to others, as understanding is the greatest motivator for action.
1014990	7000.0	Improving the Evaluation of PRIME TIME Plus	DESCRIPTION: PT Plus is a 6-week program of 90-minute weekly sessions for families with 3-5 year old children that introduces literature and nutritional practices through activities that promote family-centered foundational skills in early nutrition, healthy lifestyles, and literacy. PT Plus's balanced and holistic approach to achieving school readiness promotes healthy eating, reading behaviors, and critical thinking through the discussion of engaging books and simple high-yield nutritional practices. Piloted in 2015-2016, the 12 pilot programs showed promising results such as 58% of families reporting an increase in positive child health behaviors, 46% of families reporting an increase in healthy eating knowledge; and 54% of families reporting an increase in reading behaviors. However, many of the assessment tools were excessively complex, not easy to administer, and somewhat burdensome to participants. To enable PRIME TIME Plus to reach more communities in diverse regions across the south, a revised and more sophisticated evaluation system that tracks both the impact and sustainability of the intervention is needed. Our proposed project, Improving the Evaluation of PRIME TIME Plus, will achieve this outcome through the collaboration of two external evaluators at Louisiana State University who will assess both components (health and literacy) separately according to their expertise and together design and pilot a revised evaluation system. The proposed assessment project will assess what influences families' food shopping and meal preparation practices, what their core health and literacy needs are, and what behaviors are impacted by the PT Plus program.
1015006	1260.0	Professional Dev: Systematic Review Workshop	"DESCRIPTION: The Systematic Review Workshop: the Nuts and Bolts for Librarians is a 2.5-day hands-on, in person workshop scheduled from July 17 to July 19, 2017 held at the University of Pittsburgh's Falk Library of the Health Sciences. The aim is to prepare health sciences librarians ""to become a systematic review team collaborator and a facilitator in the systematic review process."" Activities include a mixture of group discussion, interactive lectures, and hands-on exercises. Prior training or experience in systematic reviews is not required. Overall, the workshop focuses on four topics: (1) Understanding the structure and purpose of systematic reviews (2) The reference interview and communication issues (3) Approaches to comprehensive literature searching and (4) Project organization. The workshop provides 20 MLA Continuing Education Credits."
1015030	20000.0	Subaward 2017-2018: Resources and Services for Native Peoples in Northwestern Nevada	DESCRIPTION: Support Native peoples in northwestern Nevada (greater Reno-Sparks area) by providing instruction and promoting freely available health information resources, with a focus on National Library of Medicine (NLM) content.The primary goals are to increase awareness and provide support through in-person and online education for community members from grade 8 through seniors. REMARKS: Katie Jefferson, Library Services Liaison and Library Faculty member, will assume overall leadership responsibility for this subaward. She will take the lead on development and implementation of the project, working with Mary Shultz, Library Director of Savitt Medical LIbrary, who oversaw year 1 of the subaward (which focused on community health nursing clinics).  This award will include significant travel to and from reservations. In addition to the fulfilling the primary goal of working with Native peoples, library personnel will provide information regarding careers, build partnerships for upcoming information events, and enhance information access for the local community.
1015046	1500.0	Health in the Rockies	DESCRIPTION: Goal: 1 . Increase resources and knowledge of library patrons on health related issues. 2. Make healthy eating fun, tasty, and not intimidating.  Objective: 1. Contract 3 health professionals and/or chefs knowledgeable on healthy eating to offer at least 2 classes to adults and 1 to kids. 2. Each class will introduce and explain how to use the NLM databases to explore different health options. 3. Each health professional will bring their own supplies for their classes.   Overall, Larimer County ranks high in health ratings for Colorado, but Red Feather Lakes (RFL) median household income is 46% less than the median income for the county. The closest major grocery store is a 2 hour round trip. Access to healthy food is limited in our small, isolated mountain town. This can be especially difficult for the elderly with mobility and transportation issues. Single parent families with limited income find it challenging to buy healthy, high quality food. We hope to give access to knowledge and health professionals through our library.  We will research different health professionals in the Fort Collins area to give presentations at the library on a health topic appropriate to our patrons. We will price out different options for the classes and create a schedule. A local chef will do one class with the kids and one for the adults on healthy cooking or preparing meals or snacks. All classes will be advertised and marketed through flyers, social media, the library's weblist, and word of mouth. The presenter will provide all supplies for the class. We will include NLM resources in the classes.  The classes for adults will be scheduled from May-December 2017.  The classes for kids will take place during the after school programs which run from Oct 2017-May 2018.

1015286	4980.0	Makerspace Technology Enhancement Project	DESCRIPTION: The purpose of the project is to expand the existing Makerspace 3D printing service provided by the Preston Smith Library. We have had great success with our entry level Makerbot Replicator 5th Generation Printer. By working one on one with the faculty, staff, and students, we have produced 3D models of aneurysms, retinal, cells, bio-macromolecules, prosthetic hands and other personal research. By generating 3D models using data from CT scans, protein data bank (.pdb) files, standard photographs, Adobe Illustrator files, and personal designs, we were able to connect the TTUHSC community with the wide range possibilities offered by 3D printing. As we, and our clients, have progressed in our understanding and knowledge of the 3D printing process, the library is looking to move to a 3D printer with exceptional build quality and precision that can produce high quality prints reliably. Specifically, a printer that employs stereolithographic (SLA) printing. SLA printing creates 3D objects from a liquid (photopolymer) resin. This type of printer produces highly accurate parts with smooth surface finishes which are ideal for the highly-detailed anatomy of the human body as well as finely articulated medical tools, devices, and implants.
1015287	8435.0	Exploring the future of medical modeling with a Stereolithography (SLA) 3D printer	DESCRIPTION: Stereolithography (SLA) technology is an important 3D technology for medicine because of its accuracy and print capabilities.

1015306	10000.0	Improving Awareness of NLM Resources at Continuing Care Retirement Communities	DESCRIPTION: Emergency planners will tell you the time to plan for an event is in advance of the event. Waiting until the last second can have dire consequences. So too is it true for most of life's challenges. In a business setting, managers plan far enough ahead to meet deadlines, avoid penalties, and assure proper utilization of resources. We can learn about future needs by looking at past history, as well as at current trends and making assumptions of future needs.  Our project involves educating the staff of various Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs), and identifying patient trends for Medicare and private insurance utilization. The goal is simply to identify the areas of concern, or opportunities for future planning, which can affect the demand for resources in CCRCs. This data-driven health care focus enables meeting that demand by utilizing the resources of the National Libraries of Medicine.  By making presentations to the CCRC staffs, the identification is expected to produce improvements in knowledge of health information available from the NLM, delivery systems, and assistive technology. We expect outcomes to include a better understanding of NLM resources, and better access to information.

1015507	382.0	Professional Development Award 121 Shepherd Center	DESCRIPTION: I will present at the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine on a project I have been participating in for the past year about electronic portals. Electronic portals enable people to engage in personal healthcare choices and manage on-going care. The Patient Engagement Portal (PEP), developed by two large rehabilitation hospitals that could not find an off-the-shelf solution to meet their population needs, is an easy to use tool for patients with physical and/or cognitive disabilities. PEP contains six sections - User Profile, Allergies/Medications, Equipment/Supplies, Resources, Documents, and Caregivers - that are easily identified and accessible on the home page.  PEP is tethered to the hospital EMR for initial activation of records and populating of select demographic/injury information as well as upload of admission and discharge documents. Once a patient activates an account, the patient becomes responsible for updating information and fields are no longer populated from the EMR. The goal of this dual design is to promote initial use by populating the portal with information deemed important by patients and clinical staff and then to facilitate self-reliance in portal use for managing injury conditions and coordinating with local care teams after returning to home environments.  45% of eligible patients have activated accounts and logged into the portal at least once. The average number of logins per patient is 2.4. The section of the portal that patients report is most helpful and accessed most frequently (33%) is Resources (a hospital provided list of on-line and community resources). The Documents section is the next most frequently accessed (19%). Clinicians can download patient-specific information (documents, videos, URLs) into this section to encourage portal use.

1015746	9000.0	Targeted Dissemination of NEC-Zero Resources to Reach Underserved Caregivers of Premature Infants at Risk for Necrotizing Enterocolitis (December 2017-April 2018)	"DESCRIPTION: The goal of NEC-Zero is to eliminate necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) to ""zero cases"" by increasing access to evidence-based information to promote risk awareness and prevention. NEC, a devastating intestinal complication that involves death of tissue that can spread to the entire body, affects mostly pre-term infants. Gaps in implementation of prevention evidence and parent engagement strategies may explain variation in NEC occurrence across Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs).   Working with an interdisciplinary team of academic experts and parent support group agencies, NEC-Zero's primary objective is to disseminate health information related to NEC broadly. Work to accomplish this goal will include: 1) refining the NEC-Zero toolkit by expanding multimedia content, translating materials into Spanish, and ensuring that Section 508 accessibility standards are met; 2) expanding awareness about availabiilty of NEC-Zero tools for librarians, clinicians, and consumers; and 3) improving access to NEC-Zero tools through targeted dissemination and marketing strategies to reach all libraries and NICUs in the Network of National Libraries of Medicine Pacific Southwest region (NNLM PSR).   Specifically, the workplan will: 1) expand multimedia content by partnering with University of Arizona theater students to create short video novellas about NEC in both English and Spanish; 2) refine the Spanish translation of parent-focused materials already developed for NEC-Zero and add a brochure targeting women who may deliver a pre-term infant; and 3) offer two webinars about NEC and NEC-Zero materials with continuing education credit made available to librarians (health science and public) and preemie parent organizations/clinicians (physicians, nurses, social workers, dietitians). REMARKS: A summary of the goals and objectives for the project:   1. Refine the NEC-Zero toolkit through enhanced Spanish translation, addition of multimedia content and refinement of clinical and parent-focused tools and ensure that it meets accessibility standards that are described in the Section 508 Rehabilitation Act   2. Expand awareness about availability of NEC-Zero tools to promote NEC prevention 3. Improve access to NEC-Zero tools online (e.g., MedlinePlus availability; expand web presence) to facilitate quick access by librarians, clinicians, and consumers"
1015766	14740.0	Levy Library Press and International Journal of Health Advocacy and Education	DESCRIPTION: The Levy Library at the Icahn School of Medicine is seeking funding to support the establishment of a Levy Library Press that will host a new open access international journal that will publish inter-professional research, case studies, and other scholarly articles focused on health advocacy and education and will serve as a knowledge hub in these areas. The journal will not charge authors or users and all content will be freely available online.  Group authorship across at least two health professions will be required for submission to the journal, and particular attention will be devoted to submissions by students and trainees. Inter-professional education (IPE) is a cornerstone of outstanding clinical care and a critical element in high quality health professions education. An open access, rigorous peer-reviewed journal specifically geared towards IPE, and open to publishing evidence-based research as well as best practices and evolving curricula, will be an important resource for disseminating IPE more broadly as it continues to rapidly evolve. It will be especially important in resource poor communities and countries. The journal and press will be led and managed by the Mount Sinai Health System librarians. This will enable them to work together and partner with various departments within Mount Sinai Health System and promote their involvement in the overall institutional health education, scientific and research efforts.  The journal will also serve as a health literacy vehicle offering free, vetted and reliable knowledge to communities around the world led by professional faculty members and medical librarians.

1015826	3150.0	Public Library: Akron-Summit Fitbit Cohorts	"DESCRIPTION: The Science & Technology Division of the Akron (Ohio)-Summit County Public Library plans to create a multi-week program of loaning wearable fitness trackers to groups of people for the purpose of encouraging regular and sustained increase in physical activity.   We will select groups of people from pre-existing community groups or groups selected for this purpose and treat them as a cohort - having them all at an initial program for instruction both on using the device and locating quality health information in support of increasing their activity levels as well as an initial ""weigh-in"" provided by students in the University of Akron's Department of Sport Science & Wellness Education. We will encourage participants to return midway through the program to check their weight, discover some more resources, and provide fellowship, all in order to continue the momentum developed in the initial presentation and increase motivation.  We will have a final session to weigh, encourage continued activity, and collect the trackers.  We will encourage users to continue their healthy exercise habits, and to connect with library staff on a regular basis after the project concludes. We will offer this program to several  groups through 2018."
1015846	19000.0	Customer Relations Database	DESCRIPTION: Currently we cannot track if a client who accesses the SSP has also been tested or has received Narcan. We cannot track if they are a client of Client Services, if they have seen their primary care provider, are in treatment for HIV, or are completing their treatment to be cured of Hepatitis C.  A central database would not only consolidate services across the agency, but would also be vital to coordinate care and track health outcomes -whether that is attaining an undetectable viral load in the case of HIV or achieving a cure in the case of HCV. It would also allow APW staff to provide and track information related to clients accessing information related to sexual and reproductive health, HIV/HCV/STI information, and safer sex materials and information at primary sources such as AIDSinfo (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services) and MedlinePlus (U.S. National Library of Medicine).

1015908	1500.0	VR Studio Discovery Space	DESCRIPTION: The health sciences campus at the University of Utah is very interested in virtual reality (VR) applications. These serious VR applications revolve around education for patients, students, and health professionals, training simulations, and immersive experiences. There is no centralized place on the health sciences campus for people to learn or use VR. There are smaller groups who routinely use VR, but their objective is not to expose or teach others VR. As a library, we can fill this need as a place of VR play and educational how-to. Through the creation of a VR Studio Discovery Space, the Eccles Health Sciences Library will: 1. Expand access to digital content creation tools by adding a Virtual Reality Studio to the Library's Media Design & Innovation Lab (MDIL) 2. Engage with faculty and students across the health sciences using VR for health education, creating Library VR Champions 3. Build an immersive neuro-opthalmology anatomy experience in VR to become part of the NOVEL and Moran CORE curricula* 4. Actively promote the VR Studio Discovery Space through educational programs, such as Appy Hour, hands-on workshops, events, and on-demand learning modules. We will also promote the new discover space through website, social media, and presentations. 5. Disseminate the VR content that is created through appropriate means. (Content may be available to play within the VR Studio Discovery Space, or included as part of a digital collection or exhibit, or made available through commercial venues.)

1015951	18970.0	Medical Library Project 133: Get Data [at sign]  Duke	DESCRIPTION: Get Data @ Duke (GD@D) will create a searchable, centralized, publicly-accessible catalog of research data created at Duke Health and in the School of Medicine. By making data more transparent, this catalog will foster scientific discovery, enhance transdisciplinary collaboration, and promote the re-use and linkage of data to speed translation, inform hypotheses generation and decision making.   Currently, data exists in many silos at Duke and there is not one map to help researchers inside and outside the institution identify what data is available. This catalog will initially focus on translational and clinical research data. The Medical Center Library (MCL) will establish and host the centralized data catalog. The Duke Clinical Translational Science Institute (CTSI) and Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI) will partner with the MCL to identify data sets for inclusion in the catalog.  Get Data @ Duke will utilize the NYU Data Catalog application to enhance and extend an existing website listing of data that was launched by the Duke CTSI in May, 2017 (Get Data @ Duke 1.0) as the basis of a longer term needs assessment targeted at the data needs of the Duke Community. The NYU Data Catalog is currently being implemented at several institutions and is freely available (Read et al 2017). Implementing this software will allow us to join an existing community of practice. Our implementation will be the first to focus on clinical research and translational research; therefore, we expect to develop best practices for outreach, workflow, and metadata that can be shared back with the health sciences library, research, and data communities.

1015952	18921.0	Medical Library Project 134: UNC Genomics Data Catalog	DESCRIPTION: The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) Health Sciences Library (HSL) will implement a pilot data catalog to facilitate discovery, access, and re-use of UNC-generated genomic data produced by research projects funded by NIH and other federal agencies. A 2014 UNC Genomics Data Task Force assessed UNC's data stewardship needs and recommended a data catalog as critical need. This project will be the first initiative to pursue the task force's recommendation.   Genomic and genetic data is of critical importance, allowing medical practitioners to create customized treatments targeted to an individual's genetic background. By making UNC's at-risk genomic data discoverable by the wider research community, the pilot project will contribute to the progress of medicine and public health, as well as provide U.S. health professionals with equal access to biomedical information.   To achieve these aims, the HSL data catalog team will use the New York University (NYU) open source data catalog model. From initial discussions with the NYU data catalog team, HSL determined that their model would match UNC's needs for a genomic data catalog. The flexible metadata scheme and database structure can accommodate a variety of data types and can be customized, if needed, to extend that accommodation. UNC's catalog pilot would contribute to the NYU model by demonstrating how it can be adapted to fit genomic data.   To populate the pilot catalog, the HSL team will work with existing contacts in UNC's Genome Sequencing Center, Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Center for Genome Sciences, and Center for Bioinformatics to identify interested principal investigators. The team will conduct outreach to identified investigators to learn about their research and data, raise awareness of the data catalog, promote its benefits for facilitating FAIR Data Principles, and explain its potential ability to track schedules for data object review and retention.

1016187	20000.0	How to Maximize Your Health Insurance Benefits	DESCRIPTION: Lack of access to treatment for youth living in medically underserved areas with a mental health condition can lead to poor academic performance, substance use, hospitalization, and attempted or completed suicide. The 2008 Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act requires health insurance plans to provide mental health and substance use disorder benefits equal to those of medical/surgical benefits, and the Affordable Care Act requires plans to offer mental health care benefits. Despite this advancement, surveys show that people are not aware of these changes and are not accessing the mental health care available to them through their insurance policies. Further, if youth and parents are unaware that the symptoms they are experiencing could be related to a mental health condition, they will not access care for these conditions. Through a NNLM grant From May 2017 to April 2018 DBSA improved health information literacy and access to mental health care by: educating youth influencers on how to access existing and new DBSA youth mental health information posted on MedLine in both English and Spanish; delivered workshops in underserved areas to educate and train youth influencers and parents on how youth can access greater mental health and substance use care and treatment options for themselves or their children through insurance benefits already available to them; trained them on how to work with insurance plans when benefits are denied; posted workshop presentation and webinar on MedLine—health insurance category; worked with community partners to increase knowledge of these tools; included training on how to use MedLine in workshops. To expand on this program, DBSA proposes to reach professional youth influencers to include social workers, librarians and school personnel by creating a 4-hour workshop that provides continuing education credits. Curriculum includes 2-hour instruction on insurance and mental health parity.

1016193	12358.0	Outreach: Improving Health Awareness Through Access to Quality Health Information	DESCRIPTION: This request seeks to fund the purchase and support of 20 iPads loaded with NLM consumer health information for adults and children. This proposed project is a partnership between the Charlevoix Public Library and the Munson Charlevoix Hospital Education Department. The iPads will be placed in the Library, the Hospital Wellness Workshop facility, in selected physicians' and school nurse offices and used in health clinics for American Indians and community senior events. The Health Librarian will train the health professionals to use the iPads and review specific NLM databases. The information will be reviewed semi-annually to ensure that the resources are up to date. The rural counties of Antrim and Charlevoix counties which constitutes the Library and Hospital's patron base, have many health challenges associated with obesity, diabetes and alcoholism. Access to mental health professionals and specialists is scarce. These chronic health issues combined with a general population that has limited computer skills, makes this a ideal environment to provide NLM health information for adults and children on user-friendly iPads. The mission of the Charlevoix Public Library is to connect the community to resources that educate, enrich and empower. The Library has been a partner with the Munson Charlevoix Hospital Wellness Workshop since inception, providing community health information based on NLM resources. The Wellness Workshop supports the Hospitals' mission to improve the health and wellness of the community through health education, nutrition classes and health screenings.
1016194	18279.0	Outreach: Community Health in the Library, Reinvigorating Outreach at the UIC Crawford Library	DESCRIPTION: The Community Health in the Library (CHIL): Reinvigorating Outreach at the UIC Crawford Library of the Health Sciences project will improve access to high quality, reliable health information for the city of Rockford, Illinois and the surrounding Winnebago County community. UIC's Crawford Library of the Health Sciences, hereafter referred to as the Crawford Library, has had a long history of participating in community outreach, educating the community on the National Library Medicine (NLM) resources, and housing a Consumer Health Collection specifically for the community. However, in recent years due to financial uncertainty and budget reductions throughout the state of Illinois, the Crawford Library has not been able to support the Consumer Health Collection and outreach activities at the same levels.

1016246	49883.0	Outreach: Ixodes Outreach Project	"DESCRIPTION: Early identification of LD symptoms is paramount to effective medical treatment; knowledge of symptoms, how LD spreads, and getting immediate medical treatment is the best prevention. IOP's goal is to promote awareness of health concerns associated with LD and tick-borne diseases in northeast Minnesota's isolated Arrowhead region. This will be accomplished through educational activities, a citizen-science program, and an undergraduate research experience. Education outreach will target Native American and rural populations and will include presentations at schools and environmental centers, development of LD brochures, information on MedlinePlus and the CDC tick-borne disease online reference. Workshops will be held to provide in-depth LD information; participants will be given ""Tick Kits"" and invited to be part of IOP's citizen-research program. Tick kits will contain a Tick Removal Key with the University of Minnesota Medical School (UMMS) and NLM logos, tick and LD information cards, collection tubes, and mailing envelopes for tick submission to the Principal Investigator (PI). Using tick kits from workshops, participants will provide ticks gathered in daily outdoor activities thereby assisting in identifying areas where the tick, Ixodes scapularis, shown to carry Borrelia, comes in contact with humans. A web-based ""Tick Story Map"" will further promote LD awareness. Citizen-scientists may review and contribute to the database using an online application to submit information such as weather conditions, date, time of day, vegetation and geographic terrain, and the types of activity when Ixodes tick contact occurred. College students will learn about Ixodes and LD as they gain valuable experience participating in field collections (tick drags), science enrichment activities to systematically survey for Borrelia-infected Ixodes, performing lab-based PCR analysis and presenting research poster presentations of their work."
1016247	49510.0	Outreach: Health Online: Finding Information You Can Trust	"DESCRIPTION: ""Health Online: Finding Information You Can Trust"" will help persons from underrepresented populations better access, identify and use reliable health information on the internet. With today's focus on obtaining information online or going mobile, there has become a digital divide for individuals with low health literacy, many of whom are represented among vulnerable populations, using online and other digital tools for health (Pew, 2015). Through this project, Wisconsin Health Literacy (WHL) will offer 32 ""digital health literacy"" workshops for consumers most at risk for low health literacy, including seniors and individuals with low literacy. WHL uses a proven workshop model which relies on partnership with local organizations to reach vulnerable populations through educational programs offered in trusted settings. WHL will leverage its past experience conducting over 400 of these collaborative workshops on a variety of health topics to create and implement this new program on digital health literacy. Community partners are scattered across the state and will include non-profit literacy councils, 80 of which are members of Wisconsin Literacy. Additional historic partners include public libraries, Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRCs), senior centers, Indian tribes, refugee organizations, and community health centers. (See letters of support.) The workshop delivery and training structure will emphasize training and materials that can be disseminated and used by partnering organizations so that they can continue to offer the program to new participants going forward. There is a variety of training publicly available to help consumers use online health information. A second project component involves providing 4 regional workshops for librarians, especially in rural areas, on how to effectively help persons with low health literacy find trustworthy health information."

1016289	18882.0	Public libraries as partners in addressing the opioid epidemic	DESCRIPTION: Our team at the University of Pennsylvania's Center for Public Health Initiatives (CPHI) has a longstanding commitment to expanding evidence-based health-related programming in public libraries. Opioid-related mortality in the United States has increased rapidly over the past decade, especially in Philadelphia, which has the highest overdose mortality rate among major U.S. cities. To mitigate the burden placed on public librarians who experience opioid overdoses on site, we are partnering with the Free Library of Philadelphia (FLP) and the Philadelphia Department of Public Health (PDPH) to deliver opioid awareness and harm reduction trainings to public librarians and patrons in Philadelphia. Building upon the success of our four-module Community Health Specialist training program, this project seeks to develop and test a fifth module on Opioid Harm Reduction. This module, which will be delivered in person at the South Philadelphia Library Branch (Goal 1) and online (Goal 2), will include active learning opportunities and an introduction to NLM resources to increase trainees' knowledge and self-efficacy regarding these important issues.

1016346	9692.0	Training for practice in rural and underserved areas using NLM databases and virtual reality technology	"DESCRIPTION: Stated in the mission and goals of the Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine (ARCOM) is the desire to recruit and train medical students who are focused on service to the underserved. This aim is important because Arkansas is one of the lowest ranking states in physician-to-population ratio. With over 80% of medical students who complete both their undergraduate medical education and graduate medical education in Arkansas staying in the state to practice, ARCOM strives to prepare its students to work in rural and underserved areas of the state and help improve our state's physician shortage. The goal of this project is twofold. First, because healthcare settings in rural and underserved areas may not have access to expensive subscription health information resources, we will train our students to search PubMed and other NLM databases to locate quality biomedical and clinical information, and to use MedlinePlus and HealthReach for patient education materials to support effective doctor-patient communication and improve patient compliance. Second, we will cultivate and reinforce empathy in our students toward the populations they will serve through VR software developed by Embodied Labs, a company that creates immersive, interactive VR experiences for health training. This cutting-edge technology creates first-person experiences of various medical conditions and life circumstances that our students will encounter in the field, allowing them to ""embody"" and experience the world as a patient with a particular condition, such as Alzheimer's or macular degeneration. Incorporating this training into the first two years of curriculum will better prepare our students for their rotations in the third year, three of which must occur in rural and underserved healthcare settings. In this way, ARCOM not only graduates future physicians who are likely to remain in our mission-specific areas, but who have also had the best training possible to help them serve."
1016350	80710.0	All of Us; NOLA Public Library Individualized Health Information Program	DESCRIPTION: 1. Making authoritative health information and health education accessible to the public.  2.

1016353	9321.0	Outreach: Iowa Public Health Research Center at Allen College	DESCRIPTION: Allen College, UnityPoint Health is a regionally-accredited, private, nonprofit institution of higher education located in Waterloo, Iowa. Built on a tradition of more than 90 years of excellence, Allen currently serves 625 students in seven health programs—nursing, public health, radiography, sonography, medical laboratory science, medical imaging, and occupational therapy—ranging from associates to doctorates. Allen College's Barrett Library provides access to over 33,000 library materials, including 47 databases, 3,200 online journals, 3,100 streaming videos, and over 12,000 physical texts. As a premier repository of biomedical and health information, Barrett Library seeks to link local health professionals, especially those in underserved areas, to these resources. Through the Iowa Public Health Research Center (IPHRC) at Allen College, Barrett Library will provide 25 counties in Northeast Iowa with no-cost equal access to library materials. As of right now, county health departments and government funded non-profits that provide public health services have limited access to peer-reviewed journals and are often unfamiliar with NNLM resources, which constitute the primary source of evidence-based practices needed to solve community health problems. Allen College's IPHRC project librarian will be available throughout the grant period to respond to item requests; locate, assess, and share resources; answer questions; produce literature reviews; and collaborate with healthcare providers to find the best solutions for their needs. In order to ensure that everyone involved knows how to best navigate federal health information resources, programming will include training sessions for interested participants and train-the-trainer initiatives for library staff. Expanding programming is another primary aim. Within the first year, Barrett Library hopes to add additional counties, based on capacity.
1016366	10000.0	Let's Combat Micrographia:	DESCRIPTION: Micrographia is derived from micro- which means small and -graphia which means writing. Small, cramped writing is a common symptom of Parkinson's disease. A symptom that arrives early on but one that many patients learn about in later years of their disease. The Art Cart has developed an interactive workbook, Let's Combat Micrographia, to help this population learn ways to improve their hand dexterity and handwriting. Our interactive workbook was published in 2016 and since then we created a Let's Combat Micrographia workshop series to work with patients in a group setting. This intensive six-workshop series takes them through the different chapters of the workbook to improve their handwriting and hand dexterity. As a result, we have seen improvement in many patients we have worked with. The image below depicts improvement in handwriting over the six-week period. Given the success of our preliminary workshop series, we hope to create a sustainable training program to spread awareness and help patients in the New England area learn how to improve their micrographia.

As the population continues to grow there is inherent value in providing opportunities to find meaning and beauty in aging while responding to living in an age-phobic culture. Through the use of visuals and the book, Aging with Wisdom by Olivia Ames Hoblitzelle, Beyond the Book - Discussion with the Author will provide participants the opportunity to reflect on the aging process: noticing how the body changes can provide space for reflection on life's gifts and challenges, and aging often brings family members together, creating an opportunity to heal broken relationships.
1016369	9932.0	Healthy Communities Mapping Project	DESCRIPTION: Girls Inc. of Worcester seeks support from the National Network of Libraries of Medicine to deliver a 9 month Healthy Communities Mapping Project. This mapping project will empower 90 high school students enrolled in Eureka!, our 5-year STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) college and career readiness program, to discover, map out, and engage with health resources in the Greater Worcester community, using innovative technology. The information and results of this project will be presented to more than 150 girls and their families that are enrolled in Girls Inc.'s After School program.  The purpose of the Eureka! Healthy Communities Mapping Project is to complement and enhance the Eureka! and After School programs through hands-on STEM, health resource, and library science education. Support for this project will provide 4 10th-11th grade students with externships at health-related sites (including 1 at the Lamar Soutter Library at University of Massachusetts Medical School), train up to 30 first-year Eureka! participants in the use of research tools at the Lamar Soutter Library, and instruct up to 90 high school Eureka! participants in GIS (Geographic Information Science) software, using an interactive whiteboard to facilitate increased group work. In culmination, Eureka! participants will combine the skills and lessons learned in community health resources and GIS to create a Community Health Resource Map, using interactive whiteboard technology to promote collaboration. They will then present their Community Health Resource Map to over 150 girls in grades K-12 enrolled in the After School program, as well as their families. The final project will be displayed as a printed poster and handouts in our family resource area to provide ongoing health access and education to families.
1016370	8450.0	Massachusetts-Based Health Tour	DESCRIPTION: HAMA will be conducting a Massachusetts-based health education tour from May - August 2018. The utility of this project stems from the need for more culturally-specific delivery of health information to underserved communities. Based on two studies and firsthand experience outlined in the full proposal, the overarching goal is to improve health outcomes for the Haitian community by increasing access to health information.  Through this initiative, we've set a goal to impact 20 different businesses, churches, high schools, and community organizations by providing awareness of the importance of Primary Care in the Haitian community. Furthermore, this project will be a vehicle to highlight culturally-specific health information available through Medlineplus.gov.
1016371	7541.0	Dementia Friendly Nahant	DESCRIPTION: Dementia Friendly Nahant brings the national Dementia Friendly America model to the local level. Nahant has an aging population, with an estimated 102 people experiencing some form of dementia and an estimated  168 people (often family members) caring for them, impacting nearly 8% of Nahant' s population . As the population continues to age, this percentage will continue to rise. The Dementia Friendly Nahant enlists the services of the Library, the Council on Aging, the Nahant Village Church, and Greater Lynn Senior Services to provide materials, services, and programs for people with dementia and their caregivers, as well as offer information for the general public. We hope to create meaningful experiences and decrease feelings of isolation in affected families while increasing understanding in the Nahant community.
1016372	25000.0	Promoting Health Literacy to Influence Health and Wellness of Students in the Community	DESCRIPTION: The Massachusetts Action Coalition (MAAC), which is co-led by the Organization of Nurse Leaders (ONL) and part of a national campaign to build a culture of health across the nation, proposes to develop and implement an initiative to promote health literacy and overall health and wellness of students in selected communities. In this phased project, we intend to utilize the existing structure of School Wellness Committees (SWC), which are mandated by M.G.L. c.111, §233, 105 CMR 215.000 to establish standards for School Wellness Advisory Committees in each school district in the Commonwealth under the Department of Public Health (DPH) regulations, as the venue in which we plan to increase and strengthen nursing representation to influence school polices addressing school nutrition, physical activity and related health issues that impact student health as identified by the community.  The initiative would pilot an innovative collaboration between the MAAC nurses with the National Library of Medicine (NLM) and the Massachusetts Health Council (MHC) both of which provide an impressive list of educational resources that the nurses will access and use in developing educational programing to increase awareness and offer the resources to the SWC members, who in turn, will use those to develop their student education and the school health program. Over the first year there will be three cycles of engagement with increasing numbers of nurses, SWC members and students that has potential for eventual spread across the state. The impact of this initiative fully supports the NLM goals to increase awareness of the NLM information resources, build a reputation as the primary resource for reliable and authentic content, the provision of training in the use of medical information resources and in using collaborative partnerships to strengthen the connectivity for health.
1016373	7000.0	Technology with the Times	DESCRIPTION: Technology with the Times will allow more access to technology improving the knowledge of staff, patients, and parents/caregivers.

Specifically, UNE Library Services will collaborate with the College of Osteopathic Medicine (COM) to compare three virtual reality experiences related to older adult health with first and second year medical students. The technology immerses users into hypothetical situations that provide a first-person perspective on living with aging-related diseases to increase empathy and understanding in health care providers and students, imparting knowledge about aging, dignity, and the importance of making meaningful connections in order to thrive. Comparing efficacy of modules related to macular degeneration and hearing loss, Alzheimer Disease, and end-of-life conversations and decision making will help inform use of the technology going forward. In addition, data collected from other health professions programs who continue to use the educational interventions will contribute to the project. VR stations will be available at UNE Libraries on both campuses and students will complete a virtual reality assignment as part of the curriculum. Students will be introduced to information resources available from the National Library of Medicine (NLM) related to older adults' health, geared to healthcare providers, patients, and their families. A pre and post assessment will help assess students' experiences including changes in attitude and knowledge, particularly regarding empathy. For the first time, this project will use a validated assessment tool or combination of tools to measure changes in empathy.

1016398	14839.0	Health Information Outreach 157: East Carolina University	DESCRIPTION: Residents of rural communities face increasing challenges to optimizing health and well-being. Beyond structural barriers, health disparities in rural areas are heightened due to lack of access to quality health information. This project seeks to address this issue by developing a health information literacy training (INQUIRY) tailored to rural youth. Media specialists (library and information science professionals) in middle and high schools across rural counties of Eastern NC will be instructed on how to deliver the INQUIRY training, thus providing increased access to high-quality health information to youth and their families. INQUIRY training will include multiple NLM resources and creative activities to engage youth in locating and evaluating health information while focusing content examples on substance use disorders, which is a heightened concern in rural counties of NC. The impact of this project will be expanded through provision of an on-line training on INQUIRY to be disseminated to other professionals in youth serving organizations such as public libraries. Finally, this project will comprehensively assess information needs of media specialists to inform future efforts to meet NLM's goal of equalizing health information access and empowering all consumers to make informed decisions about their health.
1016399	14918.0	Health Information Outreach 160: Virginia Commonwealth University	"DESCRIPTION: At 12% proficiency, U.S. health literacy sets the population at disadvantage for consumer health outcomes and overall healthcare costs (NCES, 2006; DHHS, 2017). While efforts exist for improvement via rewriting and training in plain language, these strategies are found to be limited ""pieces of a process that must be placed in a larger community context"" (NNLM, 2018). Witnessed in this context is variance in access to health resources multiplied by effects of social determinants such as aging, low socio-economic and minority status. Addressing these factors with cultural and community competent health literacy engages individuals in promising self-advocacy for health, but advancements of today also require technology skills to keep pace with online health communications (Levy, Janke & Langa, 2015; Sakar, Karter & Liu, 2010). Led by partners at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), the VCU School of Medicine's Center on Health Disparities (CoHD) and VCU Libraries' Community Health Education Center (CHEC), this project promotes National Library of Medicine (NLM) resources for online consumer health in interdisciplinary collaboration with public libraries, state and local health agencies. The project will provide community trainings at neighborhood centers in a historically African American, low-income, food and resource desert community of Richmond, Virginia. Participants will receive small group health literacy education via a mobile computer lab to enhance technology access, health application knowledge, and connection to health services and providers. The outreach supports NLM mission through collaborative action that addresses health information needs, improves health information literacy, and ensures healthcare consumers are aware of and have access to high-quality health information resources. This project aims to advance public health by improving access to information and skills that enable individuals to make informed decisions about their health."
1016400	1638.0	Health Information Outreach 167: Augusta University	DESCRIPTION: The Augusta-Richmond Community Health Outreach Project will provide reliable and free access health information to residents within the Richmond County. Using the public libraries as a host venue, various speakers and officials will teach participants about health issues relevant to the Augusta area such as opioid use, Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease, domestic abuse, and diabetes. Over six months, there will be six presentations about the selected topics with two of the presentations being about opioid use. The six presentations will be spread out equally over the six months and vary on time of day given. Each of the speakers will be an expert in their respective public health or health sciences fields. They will speak about the current health statistics and trends concerning their topic in the local area, warning signs of health concerns to watch for, what actions are being taken to prevent risks, and what actions are being taken to manage future risk.   Each presentation will correlate to the NNLM mission of improving access to health information and supporting outreach that promotes awareness. The health and population information shared at the presentations will integrate facts from evidence-based studies and use NLM resources.
1016401	10382.0	Health Information Outreach 172: Augusta University	DESCRIPTION: The program is to build awareness about the importance of how participating in clinical research studies can bring about better therapies for diseases. We will briefly outline the research process, and then describe how participatory research is changing how research is done - doing research with, rather than to, research subjects. We will briefly discuss how data science and the National Institutes of Health's All of Us precision medicine research program are examples of newer approaches to include rural, underrepresented, or ignored populations in the community in clinical research studies. A recent program sponsored by Augusta University about Henrietta Lacks was well received and attended so there is local interest in medical research topics. A larger amount of time will be spent demonstrating how to find disease and drug information in MedlinePlus, and then to a lesser extent, how ClinicalTrials.gov can locate studies and how PubMed Health seeks to inform about the effectiveness of therapies. This program will be coordinated with Federally Qualified Health Centers and public libraries located in urban, suburban, and rural settings as either a standalone program or part of other public outreach events. Participation in the annual Greater Augusta Healthcare Network meeting and symposium will bring the precision research message of All of Us to FQHCs, hospitals, and public health leaders in the Augusta region. Equipment will be needed to present the program and also for participating FQHCs and libraries to showcase the National Library of Medicine databases to the public.
1016404	14817.0	Medical Library Project 151: Augusta University	DESCRIPTION: Data discovery is becoming an increasing trend with the availability of public data sets as a part of the open access movement. Data sharing is developing norms and establishing standards to increase research reproducibility. Data management skills are required to execute the data life cycle steps, including creating, accessing, sharing, and re-using data. As health care begins to harness big data and other data sets for discovery purposes, scientists need to understand data management and incorporate best practices into their research.   Discussions around data management often occur within individual departments or colleges on a university campus; however, the health sciences library has the opportunity to support an interdisciplinary, consolidated effort to connect researchers and resources across all disciplines. Greenblatt Library will conduct a needs assessment of the University researchers and stakeholders to assess the current climate and knowledge of data management on campus. Using the assessment results, the library will partner with the University's Vice-President for Research, Biostatistics, IT, Cancer Center, and Center for Nursing Research to host a day-long research data management symposium. National and local speakers will be invited and the format will include breakout sessions, a panel discussion, and displaying National Library of Medicine data science resources. The symposium will be planned for spring 2019 and aims to provide professional development for university researchers and librarians, and foster collaborative relationships with the campus research community. Continuing education credit will be sought for both health professionals and librarians attending.  Greenblatt Library requests funding from NNLM/SEA Medical Library Project in support of this symposium inspiring best practices for research data management across the institution.

1016433	14999.0	Technology Improvement 161: University of South Alabama	DESCRIPTION: Continuing on PATHS Leading to Excellent Patient Care will allow patients and families of the University of South Alabama (USA) Medical Center and the High Risk OB/GYN and Well Baby units of the USA Children's & Women's Hospital to access quality health information through the use of Android tablets.  Nurse educators and other health care professionals at both facilities will have a means to enhance the current individual educational needs of the patients, parents and family members by accessing the free electronic resources from the National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health.  Android tablets and rolling bedside stands will be purchased so patients have access to these resources.  MedlinePlus, Drug Information Portal, and LactMed are a few that will be accessible so patients can locate information free of medical jargon, in their native language, and at a time when they can absorb the material.  The tablets will be available at any time during their hospital stay.  Printed brochures from the National Library of Medicine will also be distributed to patients.  One-on-one sessions will be provided by the librarian in the USA Cardiac Clinic.  This award would continue the work of a previous NNLM award received in November 2016 which enabled chronically ill children and their parents at USA Children's & Women's Hospital to access MedlinePlus and other NIH resources from tablets.  By providing access to health information using multiple educational interventions, more patients in this health disparate community can take an active role in the understanding of their condition and become engaged in an interdisciplinary team approach to their medical care.  The additional resources from NNLM will provide patients the ability to locate quality health information not only at the time of need, but beyond, thus improving their health outcomes.  The project will document the efficacy of the various interventions by using evaluations and discharge
1016434	14745.0	Technology Improvement 171: Georgetown University Medical Center	DESCRIPTION: Dahlgren Memorial Library at Georgetown University Medical Center is seeking funding for a project designed to assess the utility of iPad Mini tablet devices for use by neonatal intensive care unit and pathology residents at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, DC. Research has been conducted in the use of the iPad in several clinical point of care and training settings including with physical medicine and rehabilitation residents (Niehaus, et al, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Resident Use of iPad Mini Mobile Devices. PM R. 2015 May;7(5):512-8.) and an otolaryngology - head and neck surgery inpatient service (Crowson, et al, Utility of Daily Mobile Tablet Use for  Residents on an Otolaryngology Head & Neck Surgery Inpatient Service. J Med Syst. 2016 Mar;40(3):55). Little data has been tabulated or studies conducted to determine the clinical utility of the iPad Mini tablet device.  The Niehaus et al. study states there is minimal research on the use of smaller tablet devices in residency programs, and most of the previous studies were conducted with standard-sized iPad tablet devices. Dahlgren Memorial Library staff working with clinicians at Georgetown University Medical Center and MedStar Georgetown University Hospital propose the purchase and deployment of the devices and to study their utility in a point-of-care clinical setting as the residents rotate through various clinics onsite at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, and in clinical settings throughout the Washington DC area.  Resources staff at Dahlgren Memorial Library have built an extensive collection of electronic materials which currently provides access to 6,500 journals and 4,500 eBooks,.  All digital content in the Dahlgren Memorial Library collections are integrated into National Library of Medicine resources such as PubMed.  Deployment of the iPad devices will facilitate access to National Library of Medicine databases and Dahlgren Memorial Library resources.
1016435	13300.0	Technology Improvement 174: Carver Parks and Recreation Center	"DESCRIPTION: Chronic Illness and Disease Awareness (CIDA) is the only organization in our community that seeks to educate the Tri-Cities community about chronic illnesses. Research studies show that increasing numbers of community members have been diagnosed with chronic illnesses, exponentially growing the health illiteracy rate in our community. Recognizing this, the purpose of this project is titled ""Action Behind Education""—action that will require a two-fold project. First, in order to improve health literacy in the Tri-Cities area it is necessary that CIDA increase the number of healthcare workshops conducted and simultaneously launch Computer Lab sessions that enable, promote awareness, and use of NN/LM resources. Second, in order to provide community members access to consumer health information it is vital that the Color My World Healthy Library at Carver Parks and Recreation Center (CP&R) be updated.  CIDA's primary objective in this project is to increase health literacy among children and seniors through expanding its workshops and creating new Computer Lab sessions that provide participants with increased access to NN/LM resources. CIDA purposes to accomplish this through frequent workshops at the CP&R. These workshops are written by the CIDA administration, reviewed for accuracy by Quillen College of Medicine Library librarians, and taught by ETSU students/health professionals to children at the CP&R. Along with these workshops, CIDA is determined to promote the awareness of NN/LM resources through new e-Library Computer Lab sessions. To further increase health literacy in the Tri-Cities area, CIDA aims to create an updated e-library that promotes the awareness and use of NN/LM resources. This e-library would have resources available for children and adults on various diseases, illness prevention techniques, and healthy lifestyle tips. It is our goal that this two-fold project will ultimately reduce health illiteracy in the Tri-Cities community."

1016440	19000.0	Library Moon Walk	DESCRIPTION: To paraphrase Lao Tzu, every journey - even a 238,900-mile trip to the moon - begins with a single step. The idea of a simple action leading to profound change inspired the Mohawk Valley, Upper Hudson and Southern Adirondack Library systems to collaborate on a regional pilot project, Library   Moon Walk. This project will develop community awareness of NNLM resources and build relationships between public libraries and health organizations while encouraging people in the Mohawk Valley, Southern Adirondacks, and Capital Region of New York State to create healthy habits.  The project has two parts and a challenge. The first targets library professionals and representatives from community health organizations by providing training sessions encouraging the use of online NNLM consumer health resources. The second part focuses on 25 public libraries developing consumer health programs for the public. The challenge, will build excitement by having the public log the amount of exercise they get on a webpage, with the goal of accumulating enough steps to cover the distance it would take to walk to the moon. This goal ties into the 2019 Collaborative Summer Library Program theme, A Universe of Stories, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the first man on the moon.
1016441	19727.0	Outreach: Narrowing the Health Gap in Cincinnati	DESCRIPTION: Despite improvements in medical care and efforts to make healthcare more affordable for all Americans, many still experience significant heath disparities that result in poor health outcomes. Racial and ethnic minorities, those in rural and/or urban areas, and those living in medically underserved areas have a high risk for experiencing health related disparities. Access to authoritative health information is vital to ensuring that individuals make appropriate health decisions and reduce their risk of experiencing poor health outcomes. The University of Cincinnati Health Sciences Library in collaboration with Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), Interact for Health, and The Children's Home of Cincinnati aim to provide health information resources and healthy cooking demonstrations in an effort to increase health literacy and reduce health disparities in the greater Cincinnati region. Community-level data has provided information regarding areas of Cincinnati that would receive the greatest benefit from these resources. We will apply a targeted approach to reach individuals in these areas and provide them with easily accessible, pertinent health information, and instruction on preparing healthy, low-cost meals. 1. We will place a blood pressure kiosk and an interactive kiosk displaying health related information in a location that is frequented by individuals from these identified areas. The kiosks will allow for automated monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate and relevant health information. 2. We will host a series of cooking classes where participants will be introduced to the DASH Diet, a program that will help them reduce their risk for a number of diseases. They will learn how to prepare low cost, healthy food while also how to make budget friendly food decisions. 3. We will create a publically accessible website that will house health related videos and information for the public.
1016446	19874.0	Outreach: Wash & Learn Health Libraries in Laundromats	DESCRIPTION: Libraries Without Borders (LWB) will facilitate health literacy programs inside laundromats in 3 new counties in Minnesota as part of LWB's Wash & Learn Initiative (WALI). Implementing partners include the Minnesota State Library Services, the Saint-Paul Public Library, the Anoka County Library, and the Scott County Library. LWB will write and publish 3 case studies drawn from each county, highlighting best practices, We will share these findings across Minnesota through LWB's partnership with the State Library Services. At the macro level, LWB aims to test several new methodologies of facilitation in order to better understand how to onboard low-income families to effectively use NNLM resources. In each laundromat space, laundromat clients will gain access to curated WiFi hotspots that re-direct them to MedLine Plus resources on personal devices. LWB will also work with the library systems to facilitate health literacy workshops and convene public health organizations to offer workshops during the laundromat's peak hours.
1016447	1962.0	Outreach: Women's Health Wednesday	DESCRIPTION: We will focus on several different topics of women's health, including heart disease, reproductive safety and health, depression and mental health, eating healthy, working out, cancer, yearly screenings, autoimmune disease, caring for a loved one, and self-defense. We will hold 9 sessions, each one hour long, once per month from August through April. We want the women in our communities to understand and value their own health and wellness. We have a lot of women who have no insurance (or are under insured) that we see coming into the library asking for materials on different health topics, such as breast cancer and ways to de-stress. We want them to not only know the information from a respectable professional, but also to know that they can go to Aunt Martha's, even with no insurance, and get the help they need to stay healthy.
1016450	17846.0	Research Data: Research Data Management for Graduate Students in STEM	"DESCRIPTION: The Research Data Management Best Practice Implementation project supports the National Network of Libraries of Medicine (NNLM) goal of building ""capacity in data management practices, services and tools to support FAIR data guiding principles (1)"". This program will increase graduate student knowledge of data management best practices, promote student understanding of how data management integrates into their research work, and determine if these practices are adopted long term. This pilot uses a flipped classroom model to present the students with appropriate practices in an eight-week intensive program. In a flipped classroom, the students are expected to engage with the instructional content outside the classroom, while using the in-person classroom time to engage in activities that demonstrate competency and understanding of the content. In this program, the classroom time is used to systematically develop and holistically integrate these practices in to their research projects. The topics include discovering disciplinary standards, creating a project map, developing folder structures and file naming conventions that reflect the project workflow, and devising strategies for sustaining these practices as their projects evolve. The UIC Library has a history of sustained support for research data management through both instruction and personalized consultation. However, there is little research that demonstrates the long-term adoption of data management best practices after receiving instruction or personalized support. This pilot project is unique in that it addresses both education about data management practices and the integration of best practices into the research workflow in a personalized manner."

1016488	17574.0	Wash and Learn: Health Literacy in Laundromats	DESCRIPTION: Health literacy is a critical pathway to better health outcomes. Yet for countless low-income families, health resources like those on MedlinePlus are simply out of reach. Some are unaware of its existence while others simply lack the digital skills to find what they're looking for. By meeting people where they are—while waiting at the laundromat—Libraries Without Borders (LWB) strives to empower low-income families with the information they seek in a manner that conforms to their everyday schedule.  In partnership with the Allegheny County Library Association (ACLA), we will facilitate health literacy programs inside Sudsy's laundromat in South Park Township, PA. Once the site is set-up, we will convene community-based organizations and health providers to offer services at the laundromat according to the needs identified by librarians. We will write and publish a case study drawn from the experience of ACLA in order to gather best practices that build upon our past health literacy work in laundromats, including a recent NNLM-supported program in Minnesota. These findings will enable us to better train libraries and librarians how to integrate health literacy into the Wash and Learn Initiative, a national program led by LWB to provide educational resources in laundromats.
1016506	2993.0	It's Opening Day at the JPS Health Network Medical Library	DESCRIPTION: The project will promote the opening of the new library space would build on the momentum already generated this year and extend the reach of library service to team members not currently aware of its benefits. An additional emphasis on promoting free resources from the National Library of Medicine during the opening day event will further give team members tools to support their patients and thus improve health outcomes across the institution. A proposed library kiosk would serve as a portal to services otherwise not present without library staff, to ensure access to quality health information beyond the regular operating hours of the library. This user friendly kiosk would expand professional knowledge by leveraging technology to capture reference questions, facilitate access to the library catalog, and provide a curated list of quality health information. With the implementation of all these elements, the Opening Day project will increase and diversify traffic to the physical library space, improve service outside of operating hours, and promote awareness of freely available National Library of Medicine resources to improve patient care.

1016529	24985.0	Mobile Systems Education and Resources for Consumer Health (MSEARCH) 2018	DESCRIPTION: Mobile Systems Education and Resources for Consumer Health (MSEARCH) 2018 is an electronic skill building program focused on educating seniors' in Harris County on how to navigate National Libraries of Medicine (NLM) health information resources using mobile device technology. The program will address the information-seeking needs of seniors' while providing ready access to NLM online information resources. This program is an expansion of several previous MSEARCH programs that were developed and successfully implemented by the Greater Houston Area Health Education Center (GHAHEC) at eleven community centers since. As a result of the program, approximately 220 seniors learned basic mobile tablet device skills and were introduced to the NIHSeniorHealth.gov, Go4Life.gov and MedlinePlus.gov websites. The MSEARCH 2018 program will be carried out using a similar methodology. The target population will be reached at three centralized senior centers throughout Houston, Harris County. The program curriculum will incorporate lessons covering tools available on MedlinePlus.gov, nia.nih.gov/health, and Go4Life.gov websites. We will teach the curriculum to approximately fifteen to twenty seniors and at least one staff member at each location. For optimal results, we will partner with Baker-Ripley Neighborhood Centers, Inc., formerly Neighborhood Centers Inc., to access the target population. The agency will support the project by providing classroom space and wireless Internet access at each of its affiliated senior centers to attract participants throughout the Houston area. GHAHEC will purchase 30 mobile tablet devices to accommodate the learning needs of older adults. In addition, upon program graduation, each training location will receive one desktop computer to set-up for public Internet access. It is our desire to motivate participation in the program and empower seniors' to take a more active role in their healthcare.
