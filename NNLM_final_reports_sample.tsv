17168	17166	Final Report: Opportunities for Health Education and Disaster relief and training in the Arkansas River Valley in Northeastern Oklahoma	Accept	"<p>The Oklahoma Healthy Aging Initiative (OHAI) main goal was to provide community education to individual in the areas most affected by the flooding around the Arkansas River in Northeastern Oklahoma. Â </p>
<p>OHAI's Northeast Center of Healthy Aging located in Tulsa and covering the 19 counties surrounding Tulsa which includes: Adair, Cherokee, Craig, Creek, Delaware, McIntosh, Mayes, Muskogee, Nowata, Okfuskee, Okmulgee, Osage, Ottawa, Pawnee, Sequoyah, Tulsa and Washington counties. Â The current staff in the Northeast Center consists on one Education Specialist, one LPN Educator Â and one Education Director. Â The staff began by identifying the most heavily affected area along the Arkansas River flood area to provide the necessary programming. Â  It was also decided that classes should be held throughout the grant timeframe to allow for the most participation. Â OHAI will be providing Aging Simulation Sensitivity Training, Health Brain, Healthy Mind and also Gateway Diabetes Self-Management Education (Diabetes and Beyond) programs under this grant.Â </p>
<p>OHAI marketing strategies remained consistent through the program timeframe. Â Flyers, use of print media, marketing on social media platforms, and email blasts were the main marketing tactics used for these programs. Â OHAI had assistance from the Eastern Oklahoma Library District, Tulsa City County Library System and the Eastern Oklahoma Area Agency on Aging regarding the marketing of these programs. Â </p>
<p>OHAI's Education Director, Education Specialist and LPN Educator all took part in the programming by instructing programs or assisting in the instruction of programming. Â </p>
"	"<p>All of the activities listed will continue at the present level. Â When completed the final portion of the requirements during the COVID 19 pandemic we found that there was an interest in the Healthy Brain, Healthy Mind programming during this particularly stressful time. Â Due to these finding we are currently working on securing an additional funding source to provide this program on a virtual platform. Â We will also continue to provide these program with existing sponsored dollars. Â </p>
"	"<p>OHAI main project goals was to provide community education to individuals who were affected by the recent Arkansas River flooding. Â OHAI's goals was to provide education to 75 individuals throughout this service period. Â We did meet our goals of providing community education in the affected areas. Â However, OHAI was not as successful in providing the programming to the disaster preparedness personnel. Â Because of this OHAI only provided programming to a total of 54 individuals throughout this program period. Â </p>
<p>The goals of providing programming to disaster preparedness personal was not entirely met. Â OHAI did provide a program to health professionals, however, we were unable to secure training opportunities with the law enforcement or disaster preparedness professionals. Â While OHAI feels that everything was done to attempt to get cooperation on this goal. Â There are always ways that this could have been improved. Â </p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic and CDC restrictions would have also made it extremely difficult for law enforcement and disaster preparedness professional to take part in training. Â This could have been a major factor in not reaching this particular goal. Â </p>
"	"The funding provided allowed for many people to receive additional information regarding managing chronic health conditions and how to improve overall mental health in a particularly difficult period for individual along the Arkansas River area.  OHAI was able to provide program in economically deprived areas in Northeastern Oklahoma.  These programs also allowed those individual to gain much needed additional information regarding disaster preparedness that will be helpful for them moving forward.  These program funding also allowed OHAI to continue to provide programming in the library systems rural Oklahoma.  

While OHAI staff could provide many success stories during this project period.  We will highlight two important success stories.  The first would be when providing aging sensitivity training to health professional at the HIV/AID clinic in OHAI Northern service region, we were told by many of the staff that this program was the only training that they had received regarding dealing with an older population and their particular needs.  This not only apply to their everyday working scenarios but also the time immediately following the displacement due to the flooding.  This information has also provided some additional training for this same staff who is now dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic.  

The final success story that I would share would be the final class that we provided.  OHAI provided a Healthy Brain, Health Mind class in the middle of the COVID-19 shelter in place order.  This program was greatly appreciated by all the participants in this capacity class.  This class not only provided some very important information regarding mental health and disaster preparedness but it also allowed class participants to feel less isolated during this extremely difficult time.  "	"<p>The most unexpected result that OHAI experienced during this award period would have been the interest in virtual programming during the COVID-19 pandemic. Â OHAI offered the Healthy Brain, Healthy Mind series on a virtual platform and we experienced a great deal of interest. Â Because of this result, OHAI has increased this class offering throughout this current pandemic. Â </p>
<p>OHAI could provide a couple of recommendations for an individual wanting to apply for a similar program in their region. Â The first would be when attempting to secure interest from disaster preparedness professionals, it might be best to train them in a conference setting. Â At this time, there is not a conference available in our area for this purpose. Â </p>
"	"<p>OHAI only discovered two major barriers or problems surrounding the programming. Â The initial issue was the recruitment of disaster preparedness/response and emergency staff to provide the Aging Simulation Sensitivity Training (ASiST). Â There were multiple issues surrounding this barrier. Â OHAI staff attempted to recruit EMS in every affected regions, along with local law enforcement and other emergency personnel. Â OHAI did recruit and train the staff from Tulsa Cares, which is the only clinic providing primarily HIV/AIDS services throughout Northeastern Oklahoma. Â However, after multiple attempt to recruit these individual and service provider it was decided and approved to provide additional community education programming.Â </p>
<p>The second major barrier would be the COVID-19 pandemic. Â Once receiving the guidance by the CDC, OHAI transitioned all programming to a virtual ZOOM platform. Â This could have impacted overall attendance numbers. Â </p>

17141	17139	Final Report: NNLM All of Us Community Engagement Network Ambassador Program: Indianapolis	Accept	"<p>In collaboration with strategic partners including the Indianapolis Public Library (IndyPL), Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis, and several community non-profits, hosted a series of health education programs for the public, as well as provided training opportunities for public library staff and leaders of partner community organizations. We will identified opportunities to exhibit at area community events and health fairs. Three specific branch libraries were chosen for monthly programming at each branch, including a series of presentations on nutrition-related health topics that are relevant to the branch populations, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity. These programs improved access to health information among marginalized populations by providing health literacy instruction and promoting consumer health information resources developed and made available by the National Library of Medicine (NLM). All sessions included All of Us Research Program information to highlight the importance of reliable health information to the Program. </p>
<p>We also arranged for a mobile farm food truck to provide fresh, local produce at low cost with recipe and nutrition information. The three selected library branches received blood pressure readers in addition to the NNLM provided health information kiosk. We also placed health information kiosks at two additional library locations , bringing the total number of health information kiosks up to five total. We also created carekits for patrons who are experiencing homelessness with needed hygiene items and NNLM/All Of Us and local resources for health information. Our final program was an information table on the COVID-19 pandemic with instruction on proper hand-washing and disinfecting techniques.</p>
"	"<p>We will continue to have health information talks, we will be utilizing community partners to increase attendance by having local subject expert matters come and host talks and informational sessions. Additionally the mobile farmers market and raised garden bed building will continue once the COVID-19 pandemic allows people to gather again. We have received additional funding from NNLM to continue our All Of Us programming and plan to expand our services, this includes the hiring of an intern to help us coordinate activities going forward.</p>
"	"<p>We utilized project outcome surveys for the public library employees to fill out and paper surveys from attendees for program evaluation. We also measured attendance for all events, including community outreach tables, program attendance and user turnout at the mobile farmers market. We used statistical information provided to us from NNLM on usage statistics for the health kiosks as well as usage statistics from the blood pressure kiosks to determine their usage. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic we are unable to access the physical machines to get final usage statistics, however informal polling from IndyPL staff members says that they were used regularly and that patrons had expressed happiness that blood pressure kiosks were available and free to use.</p>
<p>We also used the increase in the number of branches wanting to have All Of Us resources at their locations. We had identified three areas that had large populations of people who are underrepresented in biomedical research, but after the roll our of our All of Us programming, we had two additional branches contact us and make a case for why they should be included.</p>
"	The impact on our  project is still being explored, we were able to successfully partner with the Indianapolis Public Library and with local non-profit organizations and small family owned businesses. We were able to create a community of curious people who are excited about the mobile farmers market and eager to learn how to prepare new vegetables. As COVID-19 shut everything down, we were just getting to a place where attendance was increasing for our programming, our goal is to continue to engage with out community in order to provide health information and nutritional resources while encouraging people to participate in All of Us. We found that engaging people within the community to amplify their voices and their understanding of All of Us. We found that it is important to engage people in discussion of All of Us and NNLM health resources as a peer, to ensure them that their voices and their concerns (health and community based) are valid and shape how we teach, learn and grow.	"<p>We learned that people are extremely interested in health information, but that time, money and other factors are large hindrances in peoples lives. By providing health information tools like the blood pressure kiosks and the NNLM health information kiosks, we found that people will seek information when it is convenient for them. From a timing perspective, we learned a lot about how long the execution of contracts work, the importance of understanding community needs and the importance of using community members and resources to market All of Us.</p>
"	"<p>Our public health and health sciences librarians created engaging content to promote health literacy, however, the primary problem we had was attendance for our health information classes. This is a common problem with adult programming in public libraries, especially because a large portion of our target population is employed at one or more jobs that make attending programming more difficult. We worked with the Indianapolis Public Library's communications department for marketing events and changing the times classes were held. Our primary method of promotion was physical signage and through the Indianapolis Public Library's social media pages.</p>
<p>We also experienced a problem with one of our initial vendors falling through and having to find a suitable replacement. The execution of contracts took time and we were unable to do some programming that required outdoor space due to adverse weather conditions.</p>
<p>The other major problem we experienced, like many other agencies was the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused the Indianapolis Public Library to close down starting in mid-march with no current full-service reopening in site.</p>

"	"<p>Shiffman Medical Library plans to continue the NNLM All of Us Community Engagement Ambassador Program in Detroit in the 2020-2021 year, with anticipated funding from NNLM. Shiffman Medical Library will continue to provide staff for the program, in the form of a 50% FTE All of Us Ambassador. The Detroit Public Library, Henry Ford Health System, other precision medicine consortium partners, and local organizations are expected to remain partners with Shiffman Medical Library in order to continue the All of Us Ambassador Program.</p>
<p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, continuation of these activities will be conducted virtually for the foreseeable future, via social media and video chat platforms. Shiffman Medical Library plans to focus on expanding its social media following and to connect with the social media staff at the Detroit Public Library in order to increase the amount of All of Us and trusted consumer health information made available to the community. In addition, Shiffman plans to begin a virtual book club with the Detroit Public Library in May for Mental Health Awareness Month. Educational health sessions on various health topics, including coping with stress and anxiety in the COVID-19 pandemic, will be hosted by the Detroit Public Library and will also continue in a virtual format for the time being. We will also continue to work with Detroit Public Library librarians to expand their health literacy knowledge and encourage them to earn their Consumer Health Information Specialization (CHIS).</p>
<p>When circumstances allow, Shiffman will begin a continuation of in-person events and activities, including installing the remaining Consumer Health Information kiosks in four Detroit Public Library branches. In addition, Shiffman plans to work with Henry Ford Health System to host All of Us pop-up enrollment events at the Detroit Public Library. A precision medicine/All of Us symposium may be held at the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History in this performance period. However, this event may also be affected by COVID-19.</p>
"	"<p>Activity reports for activities and events held during this performance period were submitted to the NNLM Data Reporting System and included information on the event, the number of event participants, and what information that was presented to the participants.</p>
<p>Activities that would have been evaluated, such as the educational health sessions and pop-up enrollment clinic, were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Evaluations of these activities and events will occur using Project Outcome when the events are held after the resumption of in-person activities by All of Us and the reopening of the Detroit Public Library. Evaluations of any virtual events that are held will also occur in the next performance period. Additionally, All of Us Baseline and Follow Up surveys will be completed by Detroit Public Library librarians in the next performance period, beginning when the library reopens.</p>
<p>Objectives 2, 4, and 5 for this project were met: Shiffman Medical Library hosted the All of Us Journey at the Detroit Public Library, with 40-45 attendees, offered a summer intern experience, and drove traffic to All of Us and other health information websites, such as Medline Plus, through social media and exhibiting at events.</p>
<p>Educational health sessions to meet Objective 1 were in development, but disrupted due to COVID-19, and will continue in the next performance period. Objective 3, to hold a precision medicine/All of Us symposium, was not met due to limited staff available to work on planning the event.</p>
"	"This project contributed toward Shiffman Medical Libraryâ€™s ability to meet its Outreach Advisory Councilâ€™s mission of being â€œa gateway to reliable health information by developing partnerships that educate, engage and empower the communityâ€. Shiffman was able to work to bring information about the All of Us Research Program and health topics to the public, via exhibiting at library events and the Consumer Health Information kiosks. Shiffman also increased the capacity of the Detroit Public Library to provide health information to its patrons by educating library staff on the All of Us Research Program and providing health information materials.

Additionally, a major success of the project was Shiffman Medical Libraryâ€™s hosting of the All of Us Journey with the Detroit Public Library and Henry Ford Health System. This event allowed Shiffman to strengthen its relationship and partnership with Henry Ford and the Detroit Public Library. In addition, participants were enrolled in the All of Us Research Program and awareness of All of Us was raised in the community, with 40-45 community members attending the event. 

Finally, partnerships made and work done in this performance period will contribute to the impact the project has on the community as Shiffman Medical Library moves forward to continue the project in the future.
"	"<p>A lesson learned from the multiple exhibit events Shiffman staff attended is the difference in impact based on audience size at an event. Reaching a large number of people is helpful in achieving project goals, but large numbers are not the only way to make an impact, and often do not make a large impact on individuals. While small events may seem disappointing, staff have the time to connect with patrons at an individual level. This allows for the most meaningful conversations to occur and for the creation of the strongest relationships between library staff and community members.</p>
<p>Shiffman staff recommend utilizing any and all contacts individuals and their organizations have to assist in achieving goals and objectives. Shiffman staff were able to use previous connections to plan a future educational health session on kidney disease, that is of great interest to the community. In addition, using any opportunity to create and cultivate new partnerships with individuals and organizations can help in achieving goals and objectives in the future.</p>
<p>In the future, when continuing this project, Shiffman Medical Library will focus more on virtual events and using social media as a tool to further reach the community. This is a strategy that has been greatly underutilized by Shiffman during this project, even before virtual events and communications were the only way in engaging the community due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
"	"<p>A limited number of staff working on the NNLM All of Us Community Engagement Ambassador Program was a barrier that was faced in pursuing project objectives. Due to a limited number of staff, Shiffman was not able to hold the proposed precision medicine and All of Us symposium at the Charles H. Wright Museum. In addition, Shiffman Medical Library also faced transitions in the roles of some staff that affected the project. An outreach librarian at Shiffman Library conducted work on the project until one 50% FTE All of Us Ambassador was hired in January 2020 to take over the majority of the work. The outreach librarian then transitioned to the role of Director of Shiffman Medical Library. The All of Us Ambassador took time after the hire date to become familiar with the All of Us Research Program, the NNLM All of Us Community Engagement Network, project goals and objectives, reporting and evaluation requirements, and project partnerships.</p>
<p>Shiffman Medical Library also faced barriers in our partnership with the Detroit Public Library. Detroit Public Library staff, particularly in the branch libraries, were slow to respond and hesitant to work with Shiffman in providing All of Us resources and programming. Agreement to the installation of the Consumer Health Information kiosks in the branch libraries was difficult to obtain, as librarians were particularly concerned with theft, security, and liability. </p>
<p>A major barrier encountered when pursuing objectives during this period was the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the pandemic, the Detroit Public Library closed in mid-March and several events and programs that were in development for April 2020 were canceled. Canceled events include educational health sessions on kidney disease and the effect of stress on physical health in African American women, a pop-up enrollment clinic with Henry Ford Health System, and Detroit Public Library author events that Shiffman staff were slated to exhibit at. In addition, the installation and use of Consumer Health Information kiosks was impacted by the pandemic. The All of Us Ambassador installed one kiosk at the main branch of the Detroit Public Library the day before their closure, resulting in one day of possible use of the kiosk by the community. The five remaining kiosks have yet to be installed in Detroit Public Library branches due to COVID-19. Shiffmanâ€™s partnership with Henry Ford Health System was also put partially on hold, as Henry Ford All of Us staff were redeployed to work on COVID-19 relief efforts.</p>

17062	17060	Final Report: Library Marketing Professional Development Award for Newville	Submit for Review	"<p>Initially, my biggest goal with the Library Marketing Professional Development Award was the learning and networking that I anticipated obtaining at the Library and Marketing Communication Conference (LMCC). However, throughout the grant cycle, the mentorship aspect quickly became the part that impacted me in a way I was not expecting.</p>
<p>With attending LMCC, attending every session that I could fit into my schedule was the biggest step to get the most out of the experience. Additionally, sharing notes with the other members of the cohort allowed the opportunity to gain knowledge from sessions that conflicted with the ones I was attending. I also gained a great deal of knowledge and strategies from the formal and informal cohort meetings, as well as networking opportunities with other attendees.<br />
Â <br />
With the mentorship aspect, I was lucky enough to be able to meet with Jim in person for the majority of our discussions when we attended conferences or meetings at the same time. We also had a variety of phone calls and chats on Slack. Missouri River Regional Library (MRRL) had a variety of challenges that came up throughout the year, and being able to talk to Jim about those challenges and get his advice and ideas really helped me navigate them, as well as utilize the examples from Mid-Continent. Our library benefited from this experience as much as I did professionally.</p>
<p>I appreciated the cohorts willingness to share ideas and resources with each other. Each member of the cohort came from such diverse backgrounds and job duties that it was very helpful to discuss our challenges and successes at our own libraries. I came away with new ways to handle things which may come up, and new strategies to reach our intended audiences when marketing MRRL.<br />
Â <br />
The time that Jim spent mentoring the group was invaluable. He has a great deal of marketing experience, and he does a great job of sharing that experience with the cohort. Additionally, he is a great listener and helps the cohort come to their own conclusions, which I appreciate.</p>

"	"<p>I plan to continue to stay in touch with Jim and the rest of the cohort after the completion of this project. The knowledge and resources that we are able to share with one another are invaluable, and I think that all of our libraries will be stronger with this partnership. Additionally, my library will continue to utilize the information and training that is provided by NNLM MCR.</p>
"	"<p>This did not apply to my professional development award.</p>
"	The most effective part of this project was the ability to connect with the cohort in person at LMCC. I think that we were able to really connect in an environment that fosters brainstorming and network, and I think our libraries and the network are all stronger because of it. I would highly recommend this process to others, as I think it is one of the best professional development opportunities available. Marketing is such as art, and connecting with others to better than skill is vital to being successful at it.	"<p>Overall, the cohort and mentorship were incredibly valuable to me as a professional. As someone who comes from a marketing background rather than a library background, I was able to connect with other library professionals and implement marketing strategies in a new way to better reach our community. Additionally, I became better aware of the resources offered by NNLM MCR, and have been able to pass them on to my co-workers and community.<br />
Â <br />
After being immersed in the current pandemic, the only thing I wish that we had done differently was to get together more often via a platform like zoom, as a group, rather than chatting via Slack. I know with as busy as everyone is, it can be hard to organize meetings like that, but I think the networking and brainstorming could have been even better than they already were if we had been â€œface to face.â€<br />

"	"<p>Though I may not be able to attend the LMCC in the future due to cutbacks in our professional development budget, I would hope that the connections I have made can help serve as a sounding board for good marketing ideas in the future.Â </p>
"	"<p>This did not apply to my professional development award.</p>
"	"This project impacted my organization by helping a library marketing team of one to be exposed to other librarians in similar situations who have developed successful programming and outreach activities. It enables this librarian to implement some of these marketing tools on our campus (thereby increasing the visibility of our tools in our student population), it also gave us ideas for how to support and educate on health literacy in our larger community in Kansas City. It will have an impact far beyond our campus. We have, as a result of this award, begun reaching out to Health Centers in our community to find a way to partner with them to support health literacy in the families that they serve, and have learned how to more effectively promote these activities on campus to raise the stature of the library and its staff. 
I have presented to my staff in a month staff meeting the ""lessons learned"" from my time at the LMCC conference. I will participate in presenting or publishing about my personal experience on the NNLM MCR blog or in a webinar. "	"<p>This professional development opportunity afforded me the chance to make professional connections I would not have made otherwise. I learned a large amount from my fellow librarians and library marketers about things that worked for them and that I could adapt and implement in my own academic library. Our face-to-face time at the conference was invaluable and would not have happened without this award. Also important was our one-on-one mentorship time with Jim Staley, who gave me access to a marketing professional who could critically discuss ideas and strategies with me. In my current position, I do not have access to someone with his depth and breadth of knowledge.Â </p>

17056	17054	Final Report: Library Marketing Professional Development Award for Brandel	Submit for Review	"<p>My goals and objectives were to increase the effectiveness of my library's marketing through the use of new marketing techniques and skills learned at the LMCC. The steps I took included introducing new flyer layouts and teaching my staff how to make concise and eye-catching marketing materials, as well as acquiring new marketing materials such as new table clothes and banners for public events outside the library building. My staff made in-house flyers, helped create and design an email campaign, and design marketing materials.</p>
"	"<p>We plan to continue looking into a new brand and new logo to improve our marketing and outreach. We are also looking into a more extensive email campaign as well as a greater reach using posters around our city.</p>
"	"<p>The methods we used to assess whether our goals were met included recording programming numbers, for programs that had been marketed, and recording patrons feedback on where they'd seen our flyers and how easy they were to read. Because programs were well attended and because feedback was positive, we believe our project goals and objectives were met.</p>
"	"The impact of this project allowed us to use newly acquired skills to reach our patrons in a more effective and seamless way. We were able to understand why previous methods did not have the desired outcomes, and had the skills and knowledge to apply new methods. Our programs have seem increased attendance and our community has responded with positive feedback in outreach and community services. 
I plan to share the information I have acquired through a conference presentation/workshop as well as through one-on-one interactions with colleagues and staff."	"<p>I believe this program were extremely positive, and would highly recommend it for other librarians. I would suggest to applicants that they be prepared to spend considerable amounts of time on their marketing and outreach, as making any type of change ends up having a profound effect on results.</p>
"	"<p>Problems we encountered included lack of finances and staff availability. We desired to restructure our brand, including new marketing materials and a possible new logo, but available funds as well as lack of available man power limited what we were able to accomplish. Â </p>

17053	17051	Final Report: Community Engagment Technology For Identifying The Health And Wellness Needs Of The Ray County Community Project	Submit for Review	"<p>1. The goals and objectives for this project are: Increased knowledge of community needs, overall insight into the health and wellness resource needs of community members, complete implementation without disrupting services, identify at least three key health indicators for the community, and identify a minimum of three areas in which to increase health related programs.<br />
2. Our first step with the project was to purchase the Savannah data management tool from Orange Boy. Â Once the product was obtained, we worked on integrating it with our Integrated Library System (ILS). Â This step was affected by the libraryâ€™s recent acquisition of a new ILS. Â Once the software installation was complete, we began accessing the data contained within the tool on a monthly basis to provide added details to our monthly statistical reports. Â We were able to discover many more details regarding how our customers use the library and our services. Â <br />
3. The Library Director uses the data from Savannah to create reports on user statistics and information, which is presented to the Library Board of Trustees. Â The Director and the Library Board then utilize this information to make decisions regarding library services and programs.</p>
"	"<p>1. Â We plan to continue the health programs that we are currently offering. Â We also plan to utilize the same partners that we identified, the Ray County Coalition for Youth, Senior Life Solutions, and Tri-County Mental Health.<br />
2. Â We have six months of service left in our agreement for the data tool and intend on continuing to access the user data to enhance monthly reports, expand our knowledge of our usersâ€™ behaviors and needs, and utilize the data to make informed decisions regarding library services. Â </p>
"	"<p>1. Â We used two methods to assess whether or not we met our goals. Â We recorded library user demographic lessons learned through the use of the data tools, and we reported on the data acquired from the software. Â The recorded information from both of these methods was contained in the final report that was presented to the Library Board of Trustees. Â <br />
2. Â Our original project goals and objectives were partially met. Â We were able to increase our knowledge of community needs, implement the data tool without interruption to existing services, identify key health indicators and identify areas to increase health related programs. Â <br />
3. Â We were not able to acquire overall insight into the health and wellness resource needs of community members with the information available from this data tool. Â The data that we can access in Orange Boy's Savannah is not specific enough for us to obtain detailed information on health and wellness resources. Â We can only access more general user behavior and demographic data, which can be correlated with outside data sources like health reports found through communitycommons.org and U.S. Census reports.</p>
"	"1.  The impact of our project was focused on data-driven decision making for our library's administration.  As a small rural library, we would not have been able to fund the project on our own.  The access of the data technology tool has been instrumental in helping us gain a better understanding of our usersâ€™ behaviors and needs.  Furthermore, it has contributed to our ability to accomplish our mission and priorities.
2.  Through the use of the data technology tool, our library was able to discover key demographic indicators for users.  That knowledge has allowed for a better understanding and subsequently better decisions from library administration regarding library services, health and wellness programs, and general community engagement.  Specifically, the knowledge acquired through this project has allowed the library to facilitate several successful programs including one called Health as a Whole, which focuses on teaching seniors about healthy lifestyles.
3.  We plan to share our project and lessons learned with colleagues through the publication of a blog post."	"<p>1. During the program, we discovered that we have specific customer demographics for some of our services. Â <br />
2. Recommendations for others who want to utilize a data technology tool would be to perform a thorough analysis of the available tools on the market and make your selection based on the specifics of your project goals. Â The most effective strategy for implementing the project was to work closely with service providers and explore the acquired data thoroughly.<br />
3. Â We would not use the same implementation strategy again. Â While the installation of the data tool was very quick, our data needed an update. Â For the tool to provide its full delivery of information, our data should have been updated prior to the implementation.<br />
4. Â If we had the opportunity to repeat this project, in the future we would work more closely with our service provider to ensure that our user data was standardized prior to installation so that we could fully utilize all of the functions and reports available.</p>
"	"<p>The problem that we encountered was with the implementation of the community engagement technology tool. Â Our library had recently joined a regional consortium with a shared ILS. Â Upon joining, all of our user records displayed a modified account creation date for the day our records were migrated in to the ILS. Â This date change affected the data output. Â In order to resolve the problem, we had to work with a variety of vendors to re-establish the original account creation dates. Â Once this update was accomplished, the data was more accurate and reflected actual usage over time.</p>
